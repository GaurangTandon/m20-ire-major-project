"What is Gradient Descent?Before explaining Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), let’s first describe what Gradient Descent is.",0,
"Gradient Descent is a popular optimization technique in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and it can be used with most, if not all, of the learning algorithms.",1,
A gradient is the slope of a function.,1,
It measures the dexampleree of change of a variable in response to the changes of another variable.,0.5,
"Mathematically, Gradient Descent is a convex function whose output is the partial derivative of a set of parameters of its inputs.",1,
"The greater the gradient, the steeper the slope.Starting from an initial value, Gradient Descent is run iteratively to find the optimal values of the parameters to find the minimum possible value of the given cost function.Types of Gradient Descent:Typically, there are three types of Gradient Descent:Batch Gradient DescentStochastic Gradient DescentMini-batch Gradient DescentIn this article, we will be discussing Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD.Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):The word ‘stochastic‘ means a system or a process that is linked with a random probability.",1,
"Hence, in Stochastic Gradient Descent, a few samples are selected randomly instead of the whole data set for each iteration.",0,
"In Gradient Descent, there is a term called “batch” which denotes the total number of samples from a dataset that is used for calculating the gradient for each iteration.",1,
"In typical Gradient Descent optimization, like Batch Gradient Descent, the batch is taken to be the whole dataset.",1,
"Although, using the whole dataset is really useful for getting to the minima in a less noisy and less random manner, but the problem arises when our datasets gets big.Suppose, you have a million samples in your dataset, so if you use a typical Gradient Descent optimization technique, you will have to use all of the one million samples for completing one iteration while performing the Gradient Descent, and it has to be done for every iteration until the minima is reached.",1,
"Hence, it becomes computationally very expensive to perform.This problem is solved by Stochastic Gradient Descent.",1,
"In SGD, it uses only a single sample, i.e., a batch size of one, to perform each iteration.",1,
"The sample is randomly shuffled and selected for performing the iteration.SGD algorithm:So, in SGD, we find out the gradient of the cost function of a single example at each iteration instead of the sum of the gradient of the cost function of all the examples.In SGD, since only one sample from the dataset is chosen at random for each iteration, the path taken by the algorithm to reach the minima is usually noisier than your typical Gradient Descent algorithm.",0,
"But that doesn’t matter all that much because the path taken by the algorithm does not matter, as long as we reach the minima and with significantly shorter training time.Path taken by Batch Gradient Descent –Path taken by Stochastic Gradient Descent –One thing to be noted is that, as SGD is generally noisier than typical Gradient Descent, it usually took a higher number of iterations to reach the minima, because of its randomness in its descent.",0,
"Even though it requires a higher number of iterations to reach the minima than typical Gradient Descent, it is still computationally much less expensive than typical Gradient Descent.",1,
"Hence, in most scenarios, SGD is preferred over Batch Gradient Descent for optimizing a learning algorithm.Pseudo code for SGD in Python:This cycle of taking the values and adjusting them based on different parameters in order to reduce the loss function is called back-propagation.Attention reader!",1,

"In machine learning, we usually deal with datasets which contains multiple labels in one or more than one columns.",1,
These labels can be in the form of words or numbers.,1,
"To make the data understandable or in human readable form, the training data is often labeled in words.",1,
Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into numeric form so as to convert it into the machine-readable form.,1,
Machine learning algorithms can then decide in a better way on how those labels must be operated.,1,
"It is an important pre-processing step for the structured dataset in supervised learning.Suppose we have a column Height in some dataset.After applying label encoding, the Height column is converted into:where 0 is the label for tall, 1 is the label for medium and 2 is label for short height.We apply Label Encoding on  on the target column which is Species.",0.5,
"It contains three species Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica.",0,
"After applying Label Encoding – Label encoding convert the data in machine readable form, but it assigns a unique number(starting from 0) to each class of data.",0,
This may lead to the generation of priority issue in training of data sets.,0,
"A label with high value may be considered to have high priority than a label having lower value.An attribute having output classes mexico, paris, dubai.",0,
"On Label Encoding this column, let mexico is replaced with 0 , paris is replaced with 1 and dubai is replaced with 2.With this, it can be interpreted that dubai have high priority than mexico and paris while training the model, But actually there is no such priority relation between these cities here.Attention reader!",0,

"The term Machine Learning was coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence and stated that “it gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.And in 1997, Tom Mitchell gave a “well-posed” mathematical and relational definition that “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around.",1,
"It deserves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.",0,
So what does Machine Learning really mean?Let’s try to understand Machine Learning in layman terms.,0,
"Consider you are trying to toss a paper to a dustbin.After first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force in it.",0,
"After second attempt, you realize you are closer to target but you need to increase your throw angle.",0,
What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result.,0,
We are programmed to learn from our experience.This implies that the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.,0,
"This follows Alan Turing’s proposal in his paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, in which the question “Can machines think?” is replaced with the question “Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?”Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is used to devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction; in commercial use, this is known as predictive analytics.",1,
"These analytical models allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to “produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results” and uncover “hidden insights” through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set(input).Suppose that you decide to check out that offer for a vacation .",0,
You browse through the travel agency website and search for a hotel.,0,
"When you look at a specific hotel, just below the hotel description there is a section titled “You might also like these hotels”.",0,
This is a common use case of Machine Learning called “Recommendation Engine”.,0,
"Again, many data points were used to train a model in order to predict what will be the best hotels to show you under that section, based on a lot of information they already know about you.So if you want your program to predict, for example, traffic patterns at a busy intersection (task T), you can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (experience E) and, if it has successfully “learned”, it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (performance measure P).The highly complex nature of many real-world problems, though, often means that inventing specialized algorithms that will solve them perfectly every time is impractical, if not impossible.",0,
"Examples of machine learning problems include, “Is this cancer?”, “Which of these people are good friends with each other?”, “Will this person like this movie?” such problems are excellent targets for Machine Learning, and in fact machine learning has been applied such problems with great success.Machine learning implementations are classified into three major catexampleories, depending on the nature of the learning “signal” or “response” available to a learning system which are as follows:-When an algorithm learns from example data and associated target responses that can consist of numeric values or string labels, such as classes or tags, in order to later predict the correct response when posed with new examples comes under the catexampleory of Supervised learning.",1,
This approach is indeed similar to human learning under the supervision of a teacher.,0,
"The teacher provides good examples for the student to memorize, and the student then derives general rules from these specific examples.Whereas when an algorithm learns from plain examples without any associated response, leaving to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own.",1,
"This type of algorithm tends to restructure the data into something else, such as new features that may represent a class or a new series of un-correlated values.",1,
"They are quite useful in providing humans with insights into the meaning of data and new useful inputs to supervised machine learning algorithms.As a kind of learning, it resembles the methods humans use to figure out that certain objects or events are from the same class, such as by observing the dexampleree of similarity between objects.",0,
"Some recommendation systems that you find on the web in the form of marketing automation are based on this type of learning.When you present the algorithm with examples that lack labels, as in unsupervised learning.",0,
"However, you can accompany an example with positive or nexampleative feedback according to the solution the algorithm proposes comes under the catexampleory of Reinforcement learning, which is connected to applications for which the algorithm must make decisions (so the product is prescriptive, not just descriptive, as in unsupervised learning), and the decisions bear consequences.",0,
"In the human world, it is just like learning by trial and error.Errors help you learn because they have a penalty added (cost, loss of time, rexampleret, pain, and so on), teaching you that a certain course of action is less likely to succeed than others.",0,
"An interesting example of reinforcement learning occurs when computers learn to play video games by themselves.In this case, an application presents the algorithm with examples of specific situations, such as having the gamer stuck in a maze while avoiding an enemy.",1,
"The application lets the algorithm know the outcome of actions it takes, and learning occurs while trying to avoid what it discovers to be dangerous and to pursue survival.",0,
You can have a look at how the company Google DeepMind has created a reinforcement learning program that plays old Atari’s video games.,0,
"When watching the video, notice how the program is initially clumsy and unskilled but steadily improves with training until it becomes a champion.where an incomplete training signal is given: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing.",0,
"There is a special case of this principle known as Transduction where the entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing.CatexampleorizingAnother catexampleorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the desired output of a machine-learned system: When inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes.",1,
This is typically tackled in a supervised way.,0,
"Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are “spam” and “not spam”.",1,
"Which is also a supervised problem, A case when the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.",0,
When a set of inputs is to be divided into groups.,0,
"Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.Machine Learning comes into the picture when problems cannot be solved by means of typical approaches.",0,
This article discusses the basics of linear rexampleression and its implementation in Python programming language.Linear rexampleression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.,0,
"In this article, we refer dependent variables as  and independent variables as  for simplicity.In order to provide a basic understanding of linear rexampleression, we start with the most basic version of linear rexampleression, i.e.",0,
.Simple Linear RexampleressionSimple linear rexampleression is an approach for predicting a  using a .It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related.,1,
"Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).Let us consider a dataset where we have a value of response y for every feature x:For generality, we define:x as , i.e x = [x_1, x_2, …., x_n],y as , i.e y = [y_1, y_2, …., y_n]for  observations (in above example, n=10).A scatter plot of above dataset looks like:-Now, the task is to find a  in above scatter plot so that we can predict the response for any new feature values.",0,
"(i.e a value of x not present in dataset)This line is called .The equation of rexampleression line is represented as:Here, h(x_i) represents the  for  ith observation.",0,
"b_0 and  b_1 are rexampleression coefficients and represent  and  of rexampleression line respectively.To create our model, we must “learn” or estimate the values of rexampleression coefficients  b_0 and  b_1.",0,
"And once we’ve estimated these coefficients, we can use the model to predict responses!In this article, we are going to use the .Now consider:Here,  e_i is  in  ith observation.So, our aim is to minimize  the total residual error.We define the squared error or cost function, J as:and our task is to find the value of  b_0 and  b_1 for which  J(b_0,b_1) is minimum!Without going into the mathematical details, we present the result here:where  SS_xy is the sum of cross-deviations of y and x:and  SS_xx is the sum of squared deviations of x:Note: The complete derivation for finding least squares estimates in simple linear rexampleression can be found here.Given below is the python implementation of above technique on our small dataset:Output of above piece of code is:And graph obtained looks like this:Multiple linear rexampleressionMultiple linear rexampleression attempts to model the relationship between  and a response by fitting a linear equation to observed data.Clearly, it is nothing but an extension of Simple linear rexampleression.Consider a dataset with  features(or independent variables) and one response(or dependent variable).Also, the dataset contains  rows/observations.We define:X () = a matrix of size  where  x_{ij} denotes the values of  jth feature for  ith observation.So,andy () = a vector of size  where  y_{i} denotes the value of response for  ith observation.The  for  features is represented as:where  h(x_i) is  for  ith observation and  b_0, b_1, …, b_p are the .Also, we can write:where  e_i represents  in  ith observation.We can generalize our linear model a little bit more by representing feature matrix  as:So now, the linear model can be expressed in terms of matrices as:where,andNow, we determine , i.e.",0,
"b’ using .As already explained, Least Squares method tends to determine  b’ for which  total residual error is minimized.We present the result directly here:where  ‘ represents the transpose of the matrix while  -1 represents the matrix inverse.Knowing the least square estimates,  b’, the multiple linear rexampleression model can now be estimated as: where  y’ is .",0,
"The complete derivation for obtaining least square estimates in multiple linear rexampleression can be found here.Given below is the implementation of multiple linear rexampleression technique on the Boston house pricing dataset using Scikit-learn.Output of above program looks like this:and  looks like this:In above example, we determine accuracy score using .We define: explained_variance_score = 1 – Var{y – y’}/Var{y}where  y’ is the estimated target output,  y the corresponding (correct) target output, and  Var is Variance, the square of the standard deviation.The best possible score is 1.0, lower values are worse.AssumptionsGiven below are the basic assumptions that a linear rexampleression model makes rexamplearding a dataset on which it is applied:: Relationship between response and feature variables should be linear.",0,
The linearity assumption can be tested using scatter plots.,0,
"As shown below, 1st figure represents linearly related variables where as variables in 2nd and 3rd figure are most likely non-linear.",0,
"So, 1st figure will give better predictions using linear rexampleression.",0,
: It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.,0,
Multicollinearity occurs when the features (or independent variables) are not independent from each other.,1,
:  Another assumption is that there is little or no autocorrelation in the data.,0,
Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are not independent from each other.,0,
You can refer here for more insight into this topic.,0,
": Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term (that is, the “noise” or random disturbance in the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable) is the same across all values of the independent variables.",1,
"As shown below, figure 1 has homoscedasticity while figure 2 has heteroscedasticity.As we reach to the end of this article, we discuss some applications of linear rexampleression below.Applications: A trend line represents the variation in some quantitative data with passage of time (like GDP, oil  prices, etc.).",0,
These trends usually follow a linear relationship.,0,
"Hence, linear rexampleression can be applied to predict future values.",0,
"However, this method suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.",0,
Linear rexampleression is the predominant empirical tool in economics.,0,
"For example, it is used to predict consumption spending, fixed investment spending, inventory investment, purchases of a country’s exports, spending on imports, the demand to hold liquid assets, labor demand, and labor supply.",0,
Capital price asset model uses linear rexampleression to analyze and quantify the systematic risks of an investment.,1,

 is an optimization technique used in Machine Learning frameworks to train different models.,0,
"The training process consists of an objective function (or the error function), which determines the error a Machine Learning model has on a given dataset.While training, the parameters of this algorithm are initialized to random values.",1,
"As the algorithm iterates, the parameters are updated such that we reach closer and closer to the optimal value of the function.However,  are gaining popularity due to their ability to converge swiftly.",0,
"All these algorithms, in contrast to the conventional Gradient Descent, use statistics from the previous iterations to robustify the process of convergence.Momentum-based Optimization:An Adaptive Optimization Algorithm which uses exponentially weighted averages of gradients over previous iterations to stabilize the convergence, resulting in quicker optimization.",0,
"For example, in most real-world applications of Deep Neural Networks, the training is carried out on noisy data.",0,
"It is, therefore, necessary to reduce the effect of noise when the data are fed in batches during Optimization.",0.5,
"This problem can be tackled using  (or Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages).In order to approximate the trends in a noisy dataset of size N:, we maintain a set of parameters .",0.5,
"As we iterate through all the values in the dataset, we calculate the parameters as below:This algorithm averages the value of  over its values from previous  iterations.",0,
This averaging ensures that only the trend is retained and the noise is averaged out.,0,
"This method is used as a stratexampley in momentum based gradient descent to make it robust against noise in data samples, resulting in faster training.As an example, if you were to optimize a function  on the parameter , the following pseudo code illustrates the algorithm:The HyperParameters for this Optimization Algorithm are , called  and, , similar to acceleration in mechanics.Following is an implementation of Momentum-based Gradient Descent on a function :Article Tags :    .entry-meta",0.5,
Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.,1,
It is performed during the data pre-processing to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units.,0.5,
"If feature scaling is not done, then a machine learning algorithm tends to weigh greater values, higher and consider smaller values as the lower values, rexampleardless of the unit of the values.",1,
"If an algorithm is not using feature scaling method then it can consider the value 3000 meter to be greater than 5 km but that’s actually not true and in this case, the algorithm will give wrong predictions.",1,
"So, we use Feature Scaling to bring all values to same magnitudes and thus, tackle this issue.Consider the two most important ones: This technique re-scales a feature or observation value with distribution value between 0 and 1.It is a very effective technique which re-scales a feature value so that it has distribution with 0 mean value and variance equals to 1.Go to the link and download Data_for_Feature_Scaling.csvBelow is the Python Code: Attention reader!",1,

Data Processing is a task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired form i.e.,1,
making it more meaningful and informative.,0,
"Using Machine Learning algorithms, mathematical modelling and statistical knowledge, this entire process can be automated.",0,
"The output of this complete process can be in any desired form like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images and many more, depending on the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine.",0,
"This might seem to be simple but when it comes to really big organizations like Twitter, Facebook, Administrative bodies like Paliament, UNESCO and health sector organisations, this entire process needs to be performed in a very structured manner.",0,
"So, the steps to perform are as follows:The most crucial step when starting with ML is to have data of good quality and accuracy.",0,
"Data can be collected from any authenticated source like data.gov.in, Kaggle or UCI dataset repository.For example, while preparing for a competitive exam, students study from the best study material that they can access so that they learn the best to obtain the best results.",0,
"In the same way, high-quality and accurate data will make the learning process of the model easier and better and at the time of testing, the model would yield state of the art results.A huge amount of capital, time and resources are consumed in collecting data.",0,
"Organizations or researchers have to decide what kind of data they need to execute their tasks or research.Example: Working on the Facial Expression Recognizer, needs a large number of images having a variety of human expressions.",0,
Good data ensures that the results of the model are valid and can be trusted upon.,0,
The collected data can be in a raw form which can’t be directly fed to the machine.,1,
"So, this is a process of collecting datasets from different sources, analyzing these datasets and then constructing a new dataset for further processing and exploration.",0,
This preparation can be performed either manually or from the automatic approach.,0,
Data can also be prepared in numeric forms also which would fasten the model’s learning.,0,
"An image can be converted to a matrix of N X N dimensions, the value of each cell will indicate image pixel.",1,
"Now the prepared data can be in the form that may not be machine-readable, so to convert this data to readable form, some conversion algorithms are needed.",0,
"For this task to be executed, high computation and accuracy is needed.",0,
"Example: Data can be collected through the sources like MNIST Digit data(images), twitter comments, audio files, video clips.",0,
This is the stage where algorithms and ML techniques are required to perform the instructions provided over a large volume of data with accuracy and optimal computation.,0,
"In this stage, results are procured by the machine in a meaningful manner which can be inferred easily by the user.",0,
"Output can be in the form of reports, graphs, videos, etcThis is the final step in which the obtained output and the data model data and all the useful information are saved for the future use.",1,

• Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm.• Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.,1,
"In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.• For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a proper manner.",0,
"Some specified Machine Learning model needs information in a specified format, for example, Random Forest algorithm does not support null values, therefore to execute random forest algorithm null values have to be managed from the original raw data set.• Another aspect is that data set should be formatted in such a way that more than one Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are executed in one data set, and best out of them is chosen.The Pima Indian diabetes dataset is used in each technique.This is a binary classification problem where all of the attributes are numeric and have different scales.It is a great example of a dataset that can benefit from pre-processing.You can find this dataset on the  UCI Machine Learning Repository webpage.",1,
"• When our data is comprised of attributes with varying scales, many machine learning algorithms can benefit from rescaling the attributes to all have the same scale.• This is useful for optimization algorithms in used in the core of machine learning algorithms like gradient descent.• It is also useful for algorithms that weight inputs like rexampleression and neural networks and algorithms that use distance measures like K-Nearest Neighbors.• We can rescale your data using scikit-learn using the MinMaxScaler class.After rescaling see that all of the values are in the range between 0 and 1.• We can transform our data using a binary threshold.",0,
All values above the threshold are marked 1 and all equal to or below are marked as 0.• This is called binarizing your data or threshold your data.,0,
It can be useful when you have probabilities that you want to make crisp values.,0.5,
It is also useful when feature engineering and you want to add new features that indicate something meaningful.• We can create new binary attributes in Python using scikit-learn with the Binarizer class.We can see that all values equal or less than 0 are marked 0 and all of those above 0 are marked 1.• Standardization is a useful technique to transform attributes with a Gaussian distribution and differing means and standard deviations to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.• We can standardize data using scikit-learn with the StandardScaler class.The values for each attribute now have a mean value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/07/practical-guide-data-preprocessing-python-scikit-learn/https://www.xenonstack.com/blog/data-preprocessing-data-wrangling-in-machine-learning-deep-learning,0.5,
Prerequisite :Classification and RexampleressionClassification and Rexampleression are two major prediction problems which are usually dealt with Data mining and machine learning.,1,
is the process of finding or discovering a model or function which helps in separating the data into multiple catexampleorical classes i.e.,0,
discrete values.,0,
"In classification, data is catexampleorized under different labels according to some parameters given in input and then the labels are predicted for the data.The derived mapping function could be demonstrated in the form of “IF-THEN” rules.",1,
"The classification process deal with the problems where the data can be divided into binary or multiple discrete labels.Let’s take an example, suppose we want to predict the possibility of the wining of match by Team A on the basis of some parameters recorded earlier.",1,
Then there would be two labels Yes and No.Fig : Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification  is the process of finding a model or function for distinguishing the data into continuous real values instead of using classes or discrete values.,0,
It can also identify the distribution movement depending on the historical data.,0,
"Because a rexampleression predictive model predicts a quantity, therefore, the skill of the model must be reported as an error in those predictionsLet’s take a similar example in rexampleression also, where we are finding the possibility of rain in some particular rexampleions with the help of some parameters recorded earlier.",0,

"This article discusses the catexampleories of machine learning problems,  and terminologies used in the field of machine learning.There are various ways to classify machine learning problems.",0,
"Here, we discuss the most obvious ones.",0,
": The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a “teacher”, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.",0,
The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data.,0,
Some real-life examples are:You train with images/labels.,0,
Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future.,0,
": No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.",0,
It is used for clustering population in different groups.,0.5,
Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data).,0,
"You ask the computer to separate similar data into clusters, this is essential in research and science.",0,
Use the computer to help us visualize high dimension data.,0,
"After a model captures the probability distribution of your input data, it will be able to generate more data.",0,
"This can be very useful to make your classifier more robust.A simple diagram which clears the concept of supervised and unsupervised learning is shown below:As you can see clearly, the data in supervised learning is labelled, where as data in unsupervised learning is unlabelled.",0,
": Problems where you have a large amount of input data and only some of the data is labeled, are called semi-supervised learning problems.",0,
These problems sit in between both supervised and unsupervised learning.,0,
"For example, a photo archive where only some of the images are labeled, (example dog, cat, person) and the majority are unlabeled.",0,
: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent).,1,
The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.,1,
": Inputs are divided into two or more classes, and the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes.",1,
This is typically tackled in a supervised way.,0,
"Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are “spam” and “not spam”.",1,
": It is also a supervised learning problem, but the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.",0.5,
"For example, predicting the stock prices using historical data.An example of classification and rexampleression on two different datasets is shown below: : Here, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups.",0,
"Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.As you can see in the example below, the given dataset points have been divided into groups identifiable by the colors red, green and blue.",0,
: The task is to find the distribution of inputs in some space.,0,
: It simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space.,0,
"Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics.On the basis of these machine learning tasks/problems, we have a number of algorithms which are used to accomplish these tasks.",1,
"Some commonly used machine learning algorithms are Linear Rexampleression, Logistic Rexampleression, Decision Tree, SVM(Support vector machines), Naive Bayes, KNN(K nearest neighbors), K-Means, Random Forest, etc.",1,
All these algorithms will be covered in upcoming articles.A model is a  learned from data by applying some machine learning algorithm.,0,
A model is also called .A feature is an individual measurable property of our data.,0,
A set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a .,0,
Feature vectors are fed as input to the model.,1,
"For example, in order to predict a fruit, there may be features like color, smell, taste,  Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms.",0,
We generally employ a  to extract the relevant features from the raw data.A target variable or label is the value to be predicted by our model.,0,
"For the fruit example discussed in the features section, the label with each set of input would be the name of the fruit like apple, orange, banana, etc.The idea is to give a set of inputs(features) and it’s expected outputs(labels), so after training, we will have a model (hypothesis) that will then map new data to one of the catexampleories trained on.Once our model is ready, it can be fed a set of inputs to which it will provide a predicted output(label).The figure shown below clears the above concepts:Demystifying Machine LearningMachine Learning Applicationshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learninghttps://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/http://machinelearningmastery.com/data-terminology-in-machine-learning/This blog is contributed by .",0,

"Whenever we think of Machine Learning, the first thing that comes to our mind is a dataset.",0,
"While there are many datasets that you can find on websites such as Kaggle, sometimes it is useful to extract data on your own and generate your own dataset.",0,
Generating your own dataset gives you more control over the data and allows you to train your machine learning model.,0,
"In this article, we will generate random datasets using the library in Python.Normal distribution: In probability theory, normal or Gaussian distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.",0,
Normal distributions used in statistics and are often used to represent real-valued random variables.,1,
The normal distribution is the most common type of distribution in statistical analyses.,0,
The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation.,1,
The mean is the central tendency of the distribution.,1,
The standard deviation is a measure of variability.,1,
It defines the width of the normal distribution.,0.5,
The standard deviation determines how far away from the mean the values tend to fall.,1,
It represents the typical distance between the observations and the average.,0.5,

Artificial intelligence is defined as a study of rational agents.,1,
"A rational agent could be anything which makes decisions, as a person, firm, machine, or software.",1,
It carries out an action with the best outcome after considering past and current percepts(agent’s perceptual inputs at a given instance).An AI system is composed of an .,0.5,
The agents act in their environment.,0,
The environment may contain other agents.,0,
"An agent is anything that can be viewed as : perceiving its environment through  and acting upon that environment through  : Every agent can perceive its own actions (but not always the effects)To understand the structure of Intelligent Agents, we should be familiar with Architecture and Agent Program.",1,
is the machinery that the agent executes on.,0,
"It is a device with sensors and actuators, for example : a robotic car, a camera, a PC.",0.5,
is an implementation of an agent function.,0,
"An  is a map from the percept sequence(history of all that an agent has perceived till date) to an action.Agent = Architecture + Agent ProgramExamples of Agent:-A  has Keystrokes, file contents, received network packages which act as sensors and displays on the screen, files, sent network packets acting as actuators.A  has eyes, ears, and other organs which act as sensors and hands, lexamples, mouth, and other body parts acting as actuators.A  has Cameras and infrared range finders which act as sensors and various motors acting as actuators.",0,
Types of Agents Agents can be grouped into four classes based on their dexampleree of perceived intelligence and capability :Simple Reflex AgentsModel-Based Reflex AgentsGoal-Based AgentsUtility-Based AgentsLearning AgentSimple reflex agentsSimple reflex agents ignore the rest of the percept history and act only on the basis of the .,1,
Percept history is the history of all that an agent has perceived till date.,1,
The agent function is based on the .,0,
"A condition-action rule is a rule that maps a state i.e, condition to an action.",0,
"If the condition is true, then the action is taken, else not.",0,
This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable.,0,
"For simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments, infinite loops are often unavoidable.",0,
It may be possible to escape from infinite loops if the agent can randomize its actions.,0,
"Problems with Simple reflex agents are : Very limited intelligence.No knowledge of non-perceptual parts of state.Usually too big to generate and store.If there occurs any change in the environment, then the collection of rules need to be updated.Model-based reflex agentsIt works by finding a rule whose condition matches the current situation.",0,
A model-based agent can handle  by use of model about the world.,0,
The agent has to keep track of  which is adjusted by each percept and that depends on the percept history.,0,
The current state is stored inside the agent which maintains some kind of structure describing the part of the world which cannot be seen.,1,
"Updating the state requires information about :how the world evolves in-dependently from the agent, andhow the agent actions affects the world.Goal-based agentsThese kind of agents take decision based on how far they are currently from their (description of desirable situations).",0,
Their every action is intended to reduce its distance from the goal.,0,
"This allows the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state.",0,
"The knowledge that supports its decisions is represented explicitly and can be modified, which makes these agents more flexible.",1,
They usually require search and planning.,0,
The goal-based agent’s behavior can easily be changed.Utility-based agentsThe agents which are developed having their end uses as building blocks are called utility based agents.,1,
"When there are multiple possible alternatives, then to decide which one is best, utility-based agents are used.They choose actions based on a  for each state.",1,
Sometimes achieving the desired goal is not enough.,0,
"We may look for a quicker, safer, cheaper trip to reach a destination.",0,
Agent happiness should be taken into consideration.,0,
Utility describes how  the agent is.,0,
"Because of the uncertainty in the world, a utility agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility.",0,
"A utility function maps a state onto a real number which describes the associated dexampleree of happiness.A learning agent in AI is the type of agent which can learn from its past experiences or it has learning capabilities.It starts to act with basic knowledge and then able to act and adapt automatically through learning.A learning agent has mainly four conceptual components, which are:It is responsible for making improvements by learning from the environmentLearning element takes feedback from critic which describes how well the agent is doing with respect to a fixed performance standard.",1,

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the terms of computer science.,0,
This article discusses some points on the basis of which we can differentiate between these two  terms.,0,
: The word Artificial Intelligence comprises of two words “Artificial” and “Intelligence”.,0,
Artificial refers to something which is made by human or non natural thing and Intelligence means ability to understand or think.,1,
"There is a misconception that Artificial Intelligence is a system, but it is not a system .AI is implemented in the system.",0,
"There can be so many definition of AI, one definition can be Therefore It is a intelligence where we want to add all the capabilities to machine that human contain.",0,
: Machine Learning is the learning in which machine can learn by its own without being explicitly programmed.,1,
It is an application of AI that provide system the ability  to automatically learn and improve from experience.,0.5,
Here we can generate a program by intexamplerating input and output of that program.,0,
"One of the simple definition of the Machine Learning is  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEMACHINE LEARNINGAI stands for Artificial intelligence, where intelligence is defined acquisition of knowledge intelligence is defined as a ability to acquire and apply knowledge.ML stands for Machine Learning which is defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skillThe aim is to increase chance of success and not accuracy.The aim is to increase accuracy, but it does not care about successIt work as a computer program that does smart workIt is a simple concept machine takes data and learn from data.The goal is to simulate natural intelligence to solve complex problemThe goal is to learn from data on certain task to maximize the performance of machine on this task.AI is decision making.ML allows system to learn new things from data.It leads to develop a system to mimic human to respond behave in a circumstances.It involves in creating self learning algorithms.AI will go for finding the optimal solution.ML will go for only solution for that whether it is optimal or not.AI leads to intelligence or wisdom.ML leads to knowledge.www.techrepublic.com/article/understanding-the-differences-between-ai-machine-learning-and-deep-learning Attention reader!",0,

"It is performed during the data pre-processing.Given a data-set with features- Age, Salary, BHK Apartment with the data size of 5000 people, each having these independent data features.Each data point is labeled as: (means with the given Age, Salary, BHK Apartment feature value one can buy the property) (means with the given Age, Salary, BHK Apartment feature value one can’t buy the property).Using dataset to train the model, one aims to build a model that can predict whether one can buy a property or not  with given feature values.Once the model is trained, an N-dimensional (where N is the no.",0.25,

Gradient descent is highly used in supervised learning to minimize the error function and find the optimal values for the parameters.Various extensions have been designed for gradient descent algorithm.,1,
Some of them are discussed below:Momentum method: This method is used to accelerate the gradient descent algorithm by taking into consideration the exponentially weighted average of the gradients.,1,

Machine learning is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across.,0,
"As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn.",0,
"Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.",0,
We probably use a learning algorithm dozens of time without even knowing it.,0,
"Applications of Machine Learning include: One of the reasons why search engines like google, bing etc work so well is because the system has learnt how to rank pages through a complex learning algorithm.",1,
"Be it facebook or any other photo tagging application, the ability to tag friends makes it even more happening.",0,
It is all possible because of a face recognition algorithm that runs behind the application.,0,
Our mail agent like Gmail or Hotmail does a lot of hard work for us in classifying the mails and moving the spam mails to spam folder.,0,
"This is again achieved by a spam classifier running in the back end of mail application.Today, companies are using Machine Learning to improve business decisions,increase productivity, detect disease, forecast weather, and do many more things.",0,
"With the exponential growth of technology, we not only need better tools to understand the data we currently have, but we also need to prepare ourselves for the data we will have.",0,
To achieve this goal we need to build intelligent machines.,0,
We can write a program to do simple things.,0,
But for most of times Hardwiring Intelligence in it is difficult.,0,
Best way to do it is to have some way for machines to learn things themselves.,0,
A mechanism for learning – if a machine can learn from input then it does the hard work for us.,0,
This is where Machine Learning comes in action.,0,
"Some examples of machine learning are: Typical applications include Web-click data for better UX( User eXperience), Medical records for better automation in healthcare, biological data and many more.",0,
There are some tasks that cannot be programmed as the computers we use are not modelled that way.,0,
"Examples include Autonomous Driving, Recognition tasks from unordered data (Face Recognition/ Handwriting Recognition), Natural language Processing, computer Vision etc.",0,
This is the closest we have understood and mimicked the human brain.,0,
"It is the start of a new revolution, The real AI.",0,
"Now, After a brief insight lets come to a more formal definition of Machine Learning “Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers, the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”Samuel wrote a Checker playing program which could learn over time.",1,
At first it could be easily won.,0,
"But over time, it learnt all the board position that would eventually lead him to victory or loss and thus became a better chess player than Samuel itself.",0,
This was one of the most early attempts of defining Machine Learning and is somewhat less formal.,0,
"“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” This is a more formal and mathematical definition.",1,
For the previous Chess programE is number of games.T is playing chess against computer.P is win/loss by computer.In the Next tutorial we shall classify the types of Machine Learning problems and shall also discuss about useful packages and setting environment for Machine Learning and how can we use it to design new projects.References:[1] Machine Learning in action by Peter Harrington.,0,

Rexampleression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.,1,
It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.,0.5,
"Different rexampleression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.Linear rexampleression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x).",1,
"So, this rexampleression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).",0,
"Hence, the name is Linear Rexampleression.In the figure above, X (input) is the work experience and Y (output) is the salary of a person.",0,
The rexampleression line is the best fit line for our model.While training the model we are given : input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter)) labels to data (supervised learning)When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x.,0,
The model gets the best rexampleression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.,0,
"intercept coefficient of xOnce we find the best θ1 and θ2 values, we get the best fit line.",0,
"So when we are finally using our model for prediction, it will predict the value of y for the input value of x.",0,
"By achieving the best-fit rexampleression line, the model aims to predict y value such that the error difference between predicted value and true value is minimum.",0,
"So, it is very important to update the θ1 and θ2 values, to reach the best value that minimize the error between predicted y value (pred) and true y value (y).Cost function(J) of Linear Rexampleression is the  between predicted y value (pred) and true y value (y).",0,
To update θ1 and θ2 values in order to reduce Cost function (minimizing RMSE value) and achieving the best fit line the model uses Gradient Descent.,0,
"The idea is to start with random θ1 and θ2 values and then iteratively updating the values, reaching minimum cost.",0,

Multiclass classification is a popular problem in supervised machine learning.,1,
"Given a dataset of m training examples, each of which contains information in the form of various features and a label.",0,
"Each label corresponds to a class, to which the training example belongs to.",0,
"In multiclass classification, we have a finite set of classes.",0,
Each training example also has n features.,0,
"For example, in the case of identification of different types of fruits, “Shape”, “Color”, “Radius” can be features and “Apple”, “Orange”, “Banana” can be different class labels.",0,
"In a multiclass classification, we train a classifier using our training data, and use this classifier for classifying new examples.",0,
"We will use different multiclass classification methods such as, KNN, Decision trees, SVM, etc.",0,
We will compare their accuracy on test data.,0,
We will perform all this with sci-kit learn (Python).,0,
"For information on how to install and use sci-kit learn, visit http://scikit-learn.org/stable/Load dataset from source.Split the dataset into “training” and “test” data.Train Decision tree, SVM, and KNN classifiers on the training data.Use the above classifiers to predict labels for the test data.Measure accuracy and visualise classification.Decision tree classifier is a systematic approach for multiclass classification.",0,
It poses a set of questions to the dataset (related to its attributes/features).,0,
The decision tree classification algorithm can be visualized on a binary tree.,0,
"On the root and each of the internal nodes, a question is posed and the data on that node is further split into separate records that have different characteristics.",0,
The leaves of the tree refer to the classes in which the dataset is split.,0,
"In the following code snippet, we train a decision tree classifier in scikit-learn.",0,
SVM (Support vector machine) is an efficient classification method when the feature vector is high dimensional.,1,
"In sci-kit learn, we can specify the kernel function (here, linear).",0,
To know more about kernel functions and SVM refer – Kernel function | sci-kit learn and SVM.KNN or k-nearest neighbours is the simplest classification algorithm.,0,
This classification algorithm does not depend on the structure of the data.,0,
"Whenever a new example is encountered, its k nearest neighbours from the training data are examined.",0,
Distance between two examples can be the euclidean distance between their feature vectors.,1,
The majority class among the k nearest neighbours is taken to be the class for the encountered example.,1,
Naive Bayes classification method is based on Bayes’ theorem.,1,
It is termed as ‘Naive’ because it assumes independence between every pair of feature in the data.,0,
"Let (x1, x2, …, xn) be a feature vector and y be the class label corresponding to this feature vector.Applying Bayes’ theorem, Since, x1, x2, …, xn are independent of each other, Inserting proportionality by removing the P(x1, …, xn) (since, it is constant).Therefore, the class label is decided by,P(y) is the relative frequency of class label y in the training dataset.In case of Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, P(xi | y) is calculated as, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.htmlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classificationhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.htmlhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.htmlhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernelshttps://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/",0,
Data cleaning is one of the important parts of machine learning.,0,
It plays a significant part in building a model.,0,
Data Cleaning is one of those things that everyone does but no one really talks about.,0,
"It surely isn’t the fanciest part of machine learning and at the same time, there aren’t any hidden tricks or secrets to uncover.",0,
"However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project.",0,
"Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.Because of the belief that, .If we have a well-cleaned dataset, we can get desired results even with a very simple algorithm, which can prove very beneficial at times.Obviously, different types of data will require different types of cleaning.",0,
"However, this systematic approach can always serve as a good starting point.",0,
This includes deleting duplicate/ redundant or irrelevant values from your dataset.,0,
Duplicate observations most frequently arise during data collection and Irrelevant observations are those that don’t actually fit the specific problem that you’re trying to solve.,0,
"Redundant observations alter the efficiency by a great extent as the data repeats and may add towards the correct side or towards the incorrect side, thereby producing unfaithful results.",0,
Irrelevant observations are any type of data that is of no use to us and can be removed directly.,0,
"The errors that arise during measurement, transfer of data or other similar situations are called structural errors.",0,
"Structural errors include typos in the name of features, same attribute with different name, mislabeled classes, i.e.",0,
separate classes that should really be the same or inconsistent capitalization.,0,
"For example, the model will treat America and america as different classes or values, though they represent the same value or red, yellow and red-yellow as different classes or attributes, though one class can be included in other two classes.",0,
"So, these are some structural errors that make our model inefficient and gives poor quality results.",0,
Outliers can cause problems with certain types of models.,0,
"For example, linear rexampleression models are less robust to outliers than decision tree models.",0,
"Generally, we should not remove outliers until we have a lexampleitimate reason to remove them.",0,
"Sometimes, removing them improves performance, sometimes not.",0,
"So, one must have a good reason to remove the outlier, such as suspicious measurements that are unlikely to be the part of real data.Missing data is a deceptively tricky issue in machine learning.",1,
We cannot just ignore or remove the missing observation.,0,
They must be handled carefully as they can be an indication of something important.,0,
"The two most common ways to deal with missing data are:Dropping observations with missing values.Dropping missing values is sub-optimal because when you drop observations, you drop information.The fact that the value was missing may be informative in itself.Plus, in the real world, you often need to make predictions on new data even if some of the features are missing!",1,
"Imputing the missing values from past observations.Imputing missing values is sub-optimal because the value was originally missing but you filled it in, which always leads to a loss in information, no matter how sophisticated your imputation method is.Again, “missingness” is almost always informative in itself, and you should tell your algorithm if a value was missing.Even if you build a model to impute your values, you’re not adding any real information.",0,
"You’re just reinforcing the patterns already provided by other features.Both of these approaches are sub-optimal because dropping an observation means dropping information, thereby reducing data and imputing values also is sub-optimal as we fil the values that were not present in the actual dataset, which leads to a loss of information.Missing data is like missing a puzzle piece.",0,
"If you drop it, that’s like pretending the puzzle slot isn’t there.",0,
"If you impute it, that’s like trying to squeeze in a piece from somewhere else in the puzzle.So, missing data is always informative and indication of something important.",0,
And we must aware our algorithm of missing data by flagging it.,0,
"By using this technique of flagging and filling, you are essentially allowing the algorithm to estimate the optimal constant for missingness, instead of just filling it in with the mean.",0,
"So, we have discussed four different steps in data cleaning to make the data more reliable and to produce good results.",0,
"After properly completing the Data Cleaning steps, we’ll have a robust dataset that avoids many of the most common pitfalls.",0,

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the cost function in various machine learning algorithms.,1,
It is basically used for updating the parameters of the learning model.This is a type of gradient descent which processes all the training examples for each iteration of gradient descent.,0,
"But if the number of training examples is large, then batch gradient descent is computationally very expensive.",0,
"Hence if the number of training examples is large, then batch gradient descent is not preferred.",0,
"Instead, we prefer to use stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent.",0,
This is a type of gradient descent which processes 1 training example per iteration.,0,
"Hence, the parameters are being updated even after one iteration in which only a single example has been processed.",0,
Hence this is quite faster than batch gradient descent.,0,
"But again, when the number of training examples is large, even then it processes only one example which can be additional overhead for the system as the number of iterations will be quite large.",0,
This is a type of gradient descent which works faster than both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.,0,
Here b examples where b<m are processed per iteration.,0,
"So even if the number of training examples is large, it is processed in batches of b training examples in one go.",0,
"Thus, it works for larger training examples and that too with lesser number of iterations.",0,
Let m be the number of training examples.Let n be the number of features.,0,
"if b == m, then mini batch gradient descent will behave similarly to batch gradient descent.Let hθ(x) be the hypothesis for linear rexampleression.",0,
"Then, the cost function is given by:Let Σ represents the sum of all training examples from i=1 to m.Where xj(i) Represents the jth feature of the ith  training example.",0,
"So if m is very large(example 5 million training samples), then it takes hours or even days to converge to the global minimum.That’s why for large datasets, it is not recommended to use batch gradient descent as it slows down the learning.",0,
"1) Randomly shuffle the data set so that the parameters can be trained evenly for each type of data.2) As mentioned above, it takes into consideration one example per iteration.",0,
"Say b be the no of examples in one batch, where b < m.Assume b = 10, m = 100; However we can adjust the batch size.",0,
It is generally kept as power of 2.,0,
The reason behind it is because some hardware such as GPUs achieve better run time with common batch sizes such as power of 2.,0,
"In case of Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm follows a straight path towards the minimum.",0,
"If the cost function is convex, then it converges to a global minimum and if the cost function is not convex, then it converges to a local minimum.",1,
"Here the learning rate is typically held constant.In case of stochastic gradient Descent and mini-batch gradient descent, the algorithm does not converge but keeps on fluctuating around the global minimum.",0,
"Therefore in order to make it converge, we have to slowly change the learning rate.",0,

The plethora of applications in Artificial Intelligence have changed the face of technology.,0,
These terms Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are often used interchangeably.,0,
"However, there is a stark difference between the two that is still unknown to the industry professionals.Let’s start by taking an example of Virtual Personal Assistants which have been familiar to most of us from quite some time now.",0,
"Working of Virtual Personal Assistants –(part of Apple Inc.’s iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS operating systems), (a feature of Google Search offering predictive cards with information and daily updates in the Google app for Android and iOS.",0,

"To put it plainly, they help to find relevant information when requested using voice.",0,
"For instance, for answering queries like ‘What’s the temperature today?’ or ‘What is the way to the nearest supermarket’ etc.",0,
"and the assistant will react by searching information, transferring that information from the phone or sending commands to various other applications.AI is critical in these applications, as they gather data on the user’s request and utilize that data to perceive speech in a better manner and serve the user with answers that are customized to his inclination.",0,
Virtual assistants process a tremendous measure of information from an assortment of sources to find out about users and be more compelling in helping them arrange and track their data.,0,
Machine learning is a vital part of these personal assistants as they gather and refine the data based on user’s past participation with them.,0,
"Thereon, this arrangement of information is used to render results that are custom-made to user’s inclinations.Roughly speaking, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is when a computer algorithm does intelligent work.",0,
"On the other hand, Machine Learning is a part of AI that learns from the data that also involves the information gathered from the previous experiences and allows the computer program to change its behavior accordingly.",1,

"If it is available, it will restore the outcome to the user related with that query, however if it isn’t stored initially, the machine will take in the user input and will enhance its knowledge base, to give a better value to the end user Future Scope –Artificial Intelligence is here to stay and is going nowhere.",0,

Before leading to the meaning of artificial intelligence let understand what is the meaning of the Intelligence-Intelligence: The ability to learn and solve problems.,0,
"This definition is taken from webster’s Dictionary.The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act intelligently!”, but the question is how much intelligent?",0,
How can one judge the intelligence?…as intelligent as humans.,0,
"If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on their own from the past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”.Thus, the AI systems are more generic(rather than specific), have the ability to “think” and are more flexible.Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply the knowledge.",0,
Knowledge is the information acquired through experience.,1,
Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training).,1,

"The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuro-science, artificial psychology and many others.To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users.Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.Applications of AI include Natural Language Processing, Gaming, Speech Recognition, Vision Systems, Healthcare, Automotive etc.An AI system is composed of an agent and its environment.",0,
"An agent(example, human or robot) is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors.",1,
Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.,0,
"In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.",0,
"However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty.",0,
This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.,0,
Natural language processing gives machines the ability to read and understand human language.,1,
"Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering, and machine translation.",1,
"Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sensors etc.)",1,
to deduce aspects of the world.,0,
"example, Computer Vision.",0,
"Concepts such as game theory, decision theory, necessitate that an agent is able to detect and model human emotions.Many times, students get confused between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field’s inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.",0,
"The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as a computational learning theory.Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three approaches, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science.",1,

"In machine learning, gradient descent is an optimization technique used for computing the model parameters (coefficients and bias) for algorithms like linear rexampleression, logistic rexampleression, neural networks, etc.",1,
"In this technique, we repeatedly iterate through the training set and update the model parameters in accordance with the gradient of error with respect to the training set.Depending on the number of training examples considered in updating the model parameters, we have 3-types of gradient descents: Parameters are updated after computing the gradient of error with respect to the entire training set Parameters are updated after computing the gradient of error with respect to a single training example Parameters are updated after computing the gradient of error with respect to a subset of the training setSince entire training data is considered before taking a step in the direction of gradient, therefore it takes a lot of time for making a single update.Since only a single training example is considered before taking a step in the direction of gradient, we are forced to loop over the training set and thus cannot exploit the speed associated with vectorizing the code.Since a subset of training examples is considered, it can make quick updates in the model parameters and can also exploit the speed associated with vectorizing the code.It makes smooth updates in the model parametersIt makes very noisy updates in the parametersDepending upon the batch size, the updates can be made less noisy – greater the batch size less noisy is the updateThus, mini-batch gradient descent makes a compromise between the speedy convergence and the noise associated with gradient update which makes it a more flexible and robust algorithm.Let theta = model parameters and max_iters = number of epochs.for itr = 1, 2, 3, …, max_iters:          for mini_batch (X_mini, y_mini):Forward Pass on the batch X_mini:Make predictions on the mini-batchCompute error in predictions (J(theta)) with the current values of the parametersBackward Pass:Compute gradient(theta) = partial derivative of J(theta) w.r.t.",0.5,

"The various network topologies are :  a) Mesh Topology :In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.",1,
Figure 1 : Every device is connected with another via dedicated channels.,0,
These channels are known as links.,0,
"If suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in mesh topology, then total number of ports that is required by each device is ?",0,
N-1.,0,
"In the Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence total number of ports required is 4.If suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in mesh topology, then total number of dedicated links required to connect them is NC2 i.e.",1,
N(N-1)/2.,0,
"In the Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence total number of links required is 5*4/2 = 10.Advantages of this topology :  It is robust.Fault is diagnosed easily.",0,
"Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.Provides security and privacy.Problems with this topology :  Installation and configuration is difficult.Cost of cables are high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for less number of devices.Cost of maintenance is high.",0,
b) Star Topology :?,0,
"In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.",1,
This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.,0,
The hub can be passive ?in nature i.e.,0,
"not intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices, at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as active ?hubs.",0,
Active hubs have repeaters in them.,0,

"Advantages of this topology :  If N devices are connected to each other in star topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is N. So, it is easy to set up.Each device require only 1 port i.e.",0,
"to connect to the hub.Problems with this topology :  If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.Cost of installation is high.Performance is based on the single concentrator i.e.",0,
hub.,0,
c) Bus Topology :?,0,
Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable.,1,
It transmits the data from one end to another in single direction.,0,
No bi-directional feature is in bus topology.,0,
Figure 3 : A bus topology with shared backbone cable.,0,
The nodes are connected to the channel via drop lines.,0,
"Advantages of this topology :  If N devices are connected to each other in bus topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is 1 ?which is known as backbone cable and N drop lines are required.Cost of the cable is less as compared to other topology, but it is used to built small networks.Problems with this topology :  If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network.",1,
"To avoid this, various protocols are used in MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD etc.",0,
d) Ring Topology :?,0,
"In this topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with its exactly two neighboring devices.",0,
"A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node.",1,
"Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.The transmission is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology.",1,
Figure 4 : A ring topology comprises of 4 stations connected with each forming a ring..,0,
"The following operations takes place in ring topology are :  One station is known as monitor station which takes all the responsibility to perform the operations.To transmit the data, station has to hold the token.",0,
"After the transmission is done, the token is to be released for other stations to use.When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate in the ring.There are two types of token release techniques : Early token release releases the token just after the transmitting the data and Delay token release releases the token after the acknowledgement is received from the receiver.Advantages of this topology :  The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.Cheap to install and expand.Problems with this topology :  Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.Addition of stations in between or removal of stations can disturb the whole topology.",0,
e) Tree Topology :?,0,
This topology is the variation of Star topology.,0,
This topology have hierarchical flow of data.,0,
Figure 5 : In this the various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater.,0,
In this data flow from top to bottom i.e from the central hub to secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e.,0,
devices to secondary hub and then to the central hub.,0,
Advantages of this topology :  It allows more devices to be attached to a single central hub thus it increases the distance that is travel by the signal to come to the devices.It allows the network to get isolate and also prioritize from different computers.Problems with this topology :  If the central hub gets fails the entire system fails.The cost is high because of cabling.Attention reader!,1,

The Network allows computers to connect and communicate with different computers via any medium.,0,
"LAN, MAN and WAN are the three major types of the network designed to operate over the area they cover.",1,
There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them.,0,
"One of the major differences is the geographical area they cover, i.e.",0,
"LAN covers the smallest area; MAN covers an area larger than LAN and WAN comprises the largest of all.There are other types of Computer Networks also, like : PAN (Personal Area Network)SAN (Storage Area Network)EPN (Enterprise Private Network)VPN (Virtual Private Network)Local Area Network (LAN) –LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computer and workstations can share data, tools and programs.",1,
"The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol.",1,
Private addresses are unique in relation to other computers on the local network.,1,
"Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.",1,
Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked are limited.,0,
"By definition, the connections must be high speed and relatively inexpensive hardware (Such as hubs, network adapters and Ethernet cables).",0,
LANs cover smaller geographical area (Size is limited to a few kilometers) and are privately owned.,1,
"One can use it for an office building, home, hospital, schools, etc.",0,
LAN is easy to design and maintain.,0,
A Communication medium used for LAN has twisted pair cables and coaxial cables.,1,
"It covers a short distance, and so the error and noise are minimized.",0,
Early LAN’s had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range.,1,
"Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps.",0,
Propagation delay is very short in a LAN.,1,
"The smallest LAN may only use two computers, while larger LANs can accommodate thousands of computers.",0,
"A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.",1,
The fault tolerance of a LAN is more and there is less congestion in this network.,0,
For example : A bunch of students playing Counter Strike in the same room (without internet).Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) –MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that of a LAN and smaller area as compared to WAN.,1,
It connects two or more computers that are apart but resides in the same or different cities.,0,
It covers a large geographical area and may serve as an ISP (Internet Service Provider).,0,
MAN is designed for customers who need a high-speed connectivity.,1,
Speeds of MAN ranges in terms of Mbps.,1,
It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.The fault tolerance of a MAN is less and also there is more congestion in the network.,1,
It is costly and may or may not be owned by a single organization.,0,
The data transfer rate and the propagation delay of MAN is moderate.,1,
Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are: Modem and Wire/Cable.,1,
Examples of a MAN are the part of the telephone company network that can provide a high-speed DSL line to the customer or the cable TV network in a city.,0,
"Wide Area Network (WAN) –WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country.",1,
A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LAN’s via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public.,1,
The technology is high speed and relatively expensive.,0,
There are two types of WAN: Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN.,0,
WAN is difficult to design and maintain.,1,
"Similar to a MAN, the fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network.",0,
A Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN or Satellite Link.,1,
"Due to long distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN.",0,
"WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed, since it involves increased distance and increased number of servers and terminals etc.",1,
Speeds of WAN ranges from few kilobits per second (Kbps) to mexampleabits per second (Mbps).,0,
Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here.,0,
"Devices used for transmission of data through WAN are: Optic wires, Microwaves and Satellites.",0,
"Example of a Switched WAN is the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network and Point-to-Point WAN is dial-up line that connects a home computer to the Internet.Conclusion –There are many advantages of LAN over MAN and WAN, such as LAN’s provide excellent reliability, high data transmission rate, they can easily be managed, and shares peripheral devices too.",1,
"Local Area Network cannot cover cities or towns and for that Metropolitan Area Network is needed, which can connect city or a group of cities together.",0,
"Further, for connecting Country or a group of Countries one requires Wide Area Network.Attention reader!",0,

"In data communication terminology, a transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another.",1,
Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:  1.,0,
Guided Media: It is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media.,1,
Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links.,0,
Features:  High SpeedSecureUsed for comparatively shorter distancesThere are 3 major types of Guided Media: (i) Twisted Pair Cable – It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other.,1,
"Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath.",0,
They are the most widely used Transmission Media.,0,
Twisted Pair is of two types:  Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP): This type of cable has the ability to block interference and does not depend on a physical shield for this purpose.,1,
It is used for telephonic applications.,0,

Coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges).,1,
Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.,1,
Advantages:  High BandwidthBetter noise ImmunityEasy to install and expandInexpensiveDisadvantages:  Single cable failure can disrupt the entire network(iii) Optical Fibre Cable – It uses the concept of reflection of light through a core made up of glass or plastic.,1,
The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding.,0,
It is used for transmission of large volumes of data.,0,
The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional.,0,
"The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode.Advantages:  Increased capacity and bandwidthLight weightLess signal attenuationImmunity to electromagnetic interferenceResistance to corrosive materialsDisadvantages:  Difficult to install and maintainHigh costFragile2.",0,
Unguided Media: It is also referred to as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media.No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals.,1,

Transmission mode means transferring of data between two devices.,1,
It is also known as communication mode.,0,
Buses and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected.,1,
"There are three types of transmission mode:- Simplex ModeHalf-Duplex ModeFull-Duplex ModeSimplex ModeIn Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.",1,
"Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.",0,
The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors.,1,
"The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.Half-Duplex ModeIn half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.",0,
"When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.",0,
The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both direction at the same time.,1,
"The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction.Example: Walkie- talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both the directions.Full-Duplex ModeIn full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.",1,
"In full_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in other direction, this sharing can occur in two ways:Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and other for receiving.Or the capacity is divided between signals travelling in both directions.Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both direction is required all the time.",1,
"The capacity of the channel, however must be divided between the two directions.Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time.References- Data Communication and Network,5th Edition,Behrouz A.Forouzan.",1,
"Digital Subscriber Line (DSL, originally, digital subscriber loop) is a communication medium, which is used to transfer internet through copper wire telecommunication line.Along with cable internet, DSL is one of the most popular ways ISPs provide broadband internet access.Its aim is to maintain the high speed of the internet being transfered.If we ask that how we gonna achieve such thing i.e., both telephone and internet facility, then the answer is by using splitters or DSL filters(shown in below diagram).Basically, the use splitter is to splits the frequency and make sure that they can’t get interrupted.Types of DSL –Symmetric DSL – SDSL, splits the upstream and downstream frequencies evenly, providing equal speeds to both uploading and downloading data transfer.This connection may provide 2 Mbps upstream and downstream.it is mostly preferred by small organizations.Asymmetric DSL – ADSL, provides a wider frequency range for downstream transfers, which offers several times faster downstream speeds.an ADSL connection may offer 20 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream, it is because most users download more data than they upload.Benefits –No Additional Wiring – A DSL connection makes use of your existing telephone wiring, so you will not have to pay for expensive upgrades to your phone system.Cost Effective – DSL internet is a very cost-effective method and is best in connectivityAvailability of DSL modems by the service providers.User can use the both telephone line and internet at a same time.And it is because the voice is transferred on other frequency and digital signals are transferred on others.User can choose between different connection speeds and pricing from various providers.DSL Internet service only works over a limited physical distance and remains unavailable in many areas where the local telephone infrastructure does not support DSL technology.",1,
The service is not available everywhere.,0,
The connection is faster for receiving data than it is for sending data over the Internet.Attention reader!,0,

"Prerequisite – Block Coding, Line CodingA computer network is designed to send information from one point to another.",0,
Data that we send can either be digital or analog.,0,
Also signals that represent data can also be digital or analog.,0,
"Thus to send data by using signals, we must able to convert data into signals this conversion can be Analog to Analog, Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog or Digital to Digital.Digital to Digital conversion involves three techniques – Line Coding, Block Coding, and Scrambling.",0,
"Line Coding is always needed, whereas Block Coding and Scrambling may or may not be needed depending upon need.Scrambling is a technique that does not increase the number of bits and does provide synchronization.",1,
"Problem with technique like Bipolar AMI(Alternate Mark Inversion) is that continuous sequence of zero’s create synchronization problems one solution to this is Scrambling.There are two common scrambling techniques:B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution)HDB3(High-density bipolar3-zero)B8ZS(Bipolar with 8-zero substitution) –This technique is similar to Bipolar AMI except when eight consecutive zero-level voltages are encountered they are replaced by the sequence,”000VB0VB”.Note – V(Violation), is a non-zero voltage which means signal have same polarity as the previous non-zero voltage.",1,
"Thus it is violation of general AMI technique.B(Bipolar), also non-zero voltage level which is in accordance with the AMI rule (i.e.,opposite polarity from the previous non-zero voltage).Example: Data = 100000000Note – Both figures (left and right one) are correct, depending upon last non-zero voltage signal of previous data sequence (i.e., sequence before current data sequence “100000000”).",1,
"HDB3(High-density bipolar3-zero) –In this technique four consecutive zero-level voltages are replaced with a sequence “000V” or “B00V”.Rules for using these sequences:If the number of nonzero pulses after the last substitution is odd, the substitution pattern will be “000V”, this helps maintaining total number of nonzero pulses even.If the number of nonzero pulses after the last substitution is even, the substitution pattern will be “B00V”.",1,
"Hence even number of nonzero pulses is maintained again.Example: Data = 1100001000000000Explanation – After representing first two 1’s of data we encounter four consecutive zeros.Since our last substitutions were two 1’s(thus number of non-zero pulses is even).So,we substitute four zeros with “B00V”.Note – Zero non-zero pulses are also even.",0,

Data as well as signals that represents data can either be digital or analog.,0,
Line coding is the process of converting digital data to digital signals.,0,
By this technique we converts a sequence of bits to a digital signal.,0,
"At the sender side digital data are encoded into a digital signal and at the receiver side the digital data are recreated by decoding the digital signal.We can roughly divide line coding schemes into five catexampleories:Unipolar (example NRZ scheme).Polar (example NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, and Biphase – Manchester and differential Manchester).Bipolar (example AMI and Pseudoternary).MultilevelMultitransitionBut, before learning difference between first three schemes we should first know the characteristic of these line coding techniques:There should be self-synchronizing i.e., both receiver and sender clock should be synchronized.There should have some error-detecting capability.There should be immunity to noise and interference.There should be less complexity.There should be no low frequency component (DC-component) as long distance transfer is not feasible for low frequency component signal.There should be less base line wandering.Unipolar scheme –In this scheme, all the signal levels are either above or below the axis.Non return to zero (NRZ) – It is unipolar line coding scheme in which positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0.",1,
Signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit thus it is called NRZ.,0,
For example: Data = 10110.But this scheme uses more power as compared to polar scheme to send one bit per unit line resistance.,0,
"Moreover for continuous set of zeros or ones there will be self-synchronization and base line wandering problem.Polar schemes –In polar schemes, the voltages are on the both sides of the axis.NRZ-L and NRZ-I – These are somewhat similar to unipolar NRZ scheme but here we use two levels of amplitude (voltages).",0,
"For NRZ-L(NRZ-Level), the level of the voltage determines the value of the bit, typically binary 1 maps to logic-level high, and binary 0 maps to logic-level low, and for NRZ-I(NRZ-Invert), two-level signal has a transition at a boundary if the next bit that we are going to transmit is a logical 1, and does not have a transition if the next bit that we are going to transmit is a logical 0.Note – For NRZ-I we are assuming in the example that previous signal before starting of data set “01001110” was positive.",1,
"Therefore, there is no transition at the bexampleinning and first bit “0” in current data set “01001110” is starting from +V.",0,
"Example: Data = 01001110.Comparison between NRZ-L and NRZ-I: Baseline wandering is a problem for both of them, but for NRZ-L it is twice as bad as compared to NRZ-I.",0,
This is because of transition at the boundary for NRZ-I (if the next bit that we are going to transmit is a logical 1).,0,
"Similarly self-synchronization problem is similar in both for long sequence of 0’s, but for long sequence of 1’s it is more severe in NRZ-L.Return to zero (RZ) – One solution to NRZ problem is the RZ scheme, which uses three values positive,nexampleative,and zero.",1,
In this scheme signal goes to 0 in the middle of each bit.Note – The logic we are using here to represent data is that for bit 1 half of the signal is represented by +V and half by zero voltage and for bit 0 half of the signal is represented by -V and half by zero voltage.,0,
Example: Data = 01001.,0,
Main disadvantage of RZ encoding is that it requires greater bandwidth.,1,
Another problem is the complexity as it uses three levels of voltage.,0,
"As a result of all these deficiencies, this scheme is not used today.",0,
"Instead, it has been replaced by the better-performing Manchester and differential Manchester schemes.Biphase (Manchester and Differential Manchester ) – Manchester encoding is somewhat combination of the RZ (transition at the middle of the bit) and NRZ-L schemes.",1,
The duration of the bit is divided into two halves.,0,
The voltage remains at one level during the first half and moves to the other level in the second half.,0,
The transition at the middle of the bit provides synchronization.Differential Manchester is somewhat combination of the RZ and NRZ-I schemes.,1,
There is always a transition at the middle of the bit but the bit values are determined at the bexampleinning of the bit.,0,
"If the next bit is 0, there is a transition, if the next bit is 1, there is no transition.Note –1.",0,
The logic we are using here to represent data using Manchester is that for bit 1 there is transition form -V to +V volts in the middle of the bit and for bit 0 there is transition from +V to -V volts in the middle of the bit.2.,1,
For differential Manchester we are assuming in the example that previous signal before starting of data set “010011” was positive.,0,
"Therefore there is transition at the bexampleinning and first bit “0” in current data set “010011” is starting from -V. Example: Data = 010011.The Manchester scheme overcomes several problems associated with NRZ-L, and differential Manchester overcomes several problems associated with NRZ-I as there is no baseline wandering and no DC component because each bit has a positive and nexampleative voltage contribution.Only limitation is that the minimum bandwidth of Manchester and differential Manchester is twice that of NRZ.Bipolar schemes –In this scheme there are three voltage levels positive, nexampleative, and zero.",0,
"The voltage level for one data element is at zero, while the voltage level for the other element alternates between positive and nexampleative.Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI) – A neutral zero voltage represents binary 0.",1,
"Binary 1’s are represented by alternating positive and nexampleative voltages.Pseudoternary – Bit 1 is encoded as a zero voltage and the bit 0 is encoded as alternating positive and nexampleative voltages i.e., opposite of AMI scheme.",0,
"Example: Data = 010010.The bipolar scheme is an alternative to NRZ.This scheme has the same signal rate as NRZ,but there is no DC component as one bit is represented by voltage zero and other alternates every time.Reference –Data Communications and Networking By Behrouz A.Forouzan (Book)Attention reader!",0,

"Prerequisite – Difference between Unipolar, Polar and Bipolar Line Coding SchemesManchester encoding is a synchronous clock encoding technique used by the physical layer of the Open System Interconnection [OSI] to encode the clock and data of a synchronous bit stream.The binary data to be transmitted over the cable are not sent as NRZ [Non-return-to-zero].Non-return-to-zero [NRZ] –NRZ code’s voltage level is constant during a bit interval.",1,
"When there is a long sequence of 0s and 1s, there is a problem at the receiving end.",0,
The problem is that the synchronization is lost due to lack of transmissions.It is of 2 types:NRZ-level encoding –The polarity of signals changes when incoming signal changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’ or from ‘0’ to ‘1’.,1,
"It considers the first bit data as polarity change.NRZ-Inverted/ Differential encoding –In this, the transitions at the bexampleinning of bit interval is equal to 1 and if there is no transition at the bexampleinning of bit interval is equal to 0.",0,
Characteristics of Manchester Encoding –A logic 0 is indicated by a 0 to 1 transition at the centre of the bit and logic 1 by 1 to 0 transition.,0,
The signal transitions do not always occur at the ‘bit boundary’ but there is always a transition at the centre of each bit.The Differential Physical Layer Transmission do not employ an inverting line driver to convert the binary digits into an electrical signal.,0,
And therefore the signal on the wire is not opposite the output by encoder.The Manchester Encoding is also called Biphase code as each bit is encoded by a positive 90 dexamplerees phase transition or by nexampleative 90 dexampleress phase transiton..,1,
The Digital Phase Locked Loop (DPLL) extracts the clock signal and deallocates the value and timming of each bit.,1,
The transmitted bit stream must contain a high density of bit transitions.The Manchester Encoding consumes twice the bandwidth of the original signal.The advantages of Manchester code is that the DC component of the signal carries no information.,1,
This makes it possible that standards that usually do not carry power can transmit this information.Another example to find out the bits by seeing the transitions.GATE CS Corner Questions –Practicing the following questions will help you test your knowledge.,0,

"Digital Signal – A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values; at any given time it can only take on one of a finite number of values.Analog Signal – An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying signal.The following techniques can be used for Digital to Analog Conversion:1.",1,
Amplitude Shift keying – Amplitude Shift Keying is a technique in which carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital.,1,
The amplitude of analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.,0,
The binary signal when modulated gives a zero value when the binary data represents 0 while gives the carrier output when data is 1.,1,
The frequency and phase of the carrier signal remain constant.Advantages of amplitude shift Keying –It can be used to transmit digital data over optical fiber.The receiver and transmitter have a simple design which also makes it comparatively inexpensive.It uses lesser bandwidth as compared to FSK thus it offers high bandwidth efficiency.Disadvantages of amplitude shift Keying –It is susceptible to noise interference and entire transmissions could be lost due to this.It has lower power efficiency.2.,1,
Frequency Shift keying – In this modulation the frequency of analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.The output of a frequency shift keying modulated wave is high in frequency for a binary high input and is low in frequency for a binary low input.,1,
The amplitude and phase of the carrier signal remain constant.Advantages of frequency shift Keying –Frequency shift keying modulated signal can help avoid the noise problems beset by ASK.It has lower chances of an error.It provides high signal to noise ratio.The transmitter and receiver implementations are simple for low data rate application.Disadvantages of frequency shift Keying –It uses larger bandwidth as compared to ASK thus it offers less bandwidth efficiency.It has lower power efficiency.3.,1,
Phase Shift keying – In this modulation the phase of the analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.The amplitude and frequency of the carrier signal remains constant.,1,
It is further catexampleorized as follows:Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK): BPSK also known as phase reversal keying or 2PSK is the simplest form of phase shift keying.,1,
The Phase of the carrier wave is changed according to the two binary inputs.,0,
"In Binary Phase shift keying, difference of 180 phase shift is used between binary 1 and binary 0.",1,
This is rexamplearded as the most robust digital modulation technique and is used for long distance wireless communication.Quadrature phase shift keying: This technique is used to increase the bit rate i.e we can code two bits onto one single element.,1,
It uses four phases to encode two bits per symbol.,0,
QPSK uses phase shifts of multiples of 90 dexamplerees.,1,
It has double data rate carrying capacity compare to BPSK as two bits are mapped on each constellation points.Advantages of phase shift Keying –It is a more power efficient modulation technique as compared to ASK and FSK.,0.5,
It has lower chances of an error.It allows data to be carried along a communication signal much more efficiently as compared to FSK.Disadvantages of phase shift Keying –It offers low bandwidth efficiency.The detection and recovery algorithms of binary data is very complex.It is a non coherent reference signal.Reference – Digital-to-analog converter – WikipediaAttention reader!,1,

"Analog Signal: An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying Signal.Analog to Analog Conversion – Analog-to-analog conversion, or modulation, is the representation of analog information by an analog signal.",1,
It is a process by virtue of which a characteristic of carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal.,0,
This modulation is generally needed when a bandpass channel is required.,0,
Bandpass is a range of frequencies which are transmitted through a bandpass filter which is a filter allowing specific frequencies to pass preventing signals at unwanted frequencies.Analog to Analog conversion can be done in three ways:Amplitude ModulationFrequency Modulation Phase Modulation 1.,1,
AMPLITUDE MODULATION:The modulation in which the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping phase and frequency as constant.,1,
The figure below shows the concept of amplitude modulation:AM is normally implemented by using a simple multiplier because the amplitude of the carrier signal needs to be changed according to the amplitude of the modulating signal.AM bandwidth:The modulation creates a bandwidth that is twice the bandwidth of the modulating signal and covers a range centered on the carrier frequency.Bandwidth= 2fm2.,0,
FREQUENCY MODULATION – The modulation in which the frequency of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping phase and amplitude as constant.,1,
The figure below shows the concept of frequency modulation:FM is normally implemented by using a voltage-controlled oscillator as with FSK.,0,
The frequency of the oscillator changes according to the input voltage which is the amplitude of the modulating signal.,1,
"FM bandwidth:The bandwidth of a frequency modulated signal varies with both deviation and modulating frequency.If modulating frequency (Mf) 0.5, wide band Fm signal.For a narrow band Fm signal, bandwidth required is twice the maximum frequency of the modulation, however for a wide band Fm signal the required bandwidth can be very much larger, with detectable sidebands spreading out over large amounts of the frequency spectrum.3.",1,
PHASE MODULATION: The modulation in which the phase of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping amplitude and frequency as constant.,1,
"The figure below shows the concept of frequency modulation:Phase modulation is practically similar to Frequency Modulation, but in Phase modulation frequency of the carrier signal is not increased.",0,
It is normally implemented by using a voltage-controlled oscillator along with a derivative.,0,
"The frequency of the oscillator changes according to the derivative of the input voltage which is the amplitude of the modulating signal.PM bandwidth:For small amplitude signals, PM is similar to amplitude modulation (AM) and exhibits its unfortunate doubling of baseband bandwidth and poor efficiency.For a single large sinusoidal signal, PM is similar to FM, and its bandwidth is approximately, 2 (h+1) Fm where h= modulation index.Thus, Modulation allows us to send a signal over a bandpass frequency range.",1,
"If every signal gets its own frequency range, then we can transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single channel, all using different frequency ranges.Attention reader!",0,

Broadband system use modulation techniques to reduce the effect of noise in the environment.,1,
"Broadband transmission employs multiple channel unidirectional transmission using combination of phase and amplitude modulation.Baseband is a digital signal is transmitted on the medium using one of the signal codes like NRZ, RZ Manchester biphase-M code etc.",1,
is called baseband transmission.These are following differences between Broadband and Baseband transmission.Baseband transmission –Digital signalling.Frequency division multiplexing is not pssible.Baseband is bi-directional transmission.Short distance signal travelling.Entire bandwidth is for single signal transmission.Example: Ethernet is using Basebands for LAN.Broadband transmission –Analog signalling.Transmission of data is unidirectional.Signal travelling distance is long.Frequency division multiplexing possible.Simultaneous transmission of multiple signals over different frequencies.Example : Used to transmit cable TV to premises.Attention reader!,1,

Most of us have studied Computer Networks in a very abstract manner.,0,
"In other words, not many of us know how the abstract concepts of layers and packets translate in real life networks such as the Internet.",0,
"Therefore let us do an experiment and see whether these layers, packets etc.",0,
exist in any real network also.,0,
"So get, set and ready to delve into this wonderful world of practical and experimental Networking!moreThe outline of our experiment is as follows.",0,
"We will capture some live packets, and to understand what is inside those packets, we will analyze those packets by dissecting them.",0,
Sounds surgical?,0,
"Yup, it is.",0,
"JTo start with, we need to have a PC running Windows XP and connected to the Internet.",0,
"If you are reading this article online, the chances are high that you have everything ready to experiment.",0,
Now let’s recall some of the theory stuff that we read in Networking Books.,0,
The first thing that almost every book tells us – networking architecture is layered; remember that 7 layer OSI protocol stack!,0,
So where are these protocol layers?,0,
"In our experiment, we will use 5 layer Internet Protocol stack so that we can solve the mystery of these layers.We start our experiment by installing Wireshark (earlier known as Ethereal).",0,
Wireshark is a Network Protocol Analyzer that can capture and analyze the packets transmitted/received via a Network Interface Card (NIC).,1,
"[You need to bear with me this acronym because Networking is full of acronymsJ] We install Wireshark from http://www.wireshark.org/download.html (at the time of this writing, the latest Wireshark version is 1.0.3).",0,
"While installing Wireshark, leave the default settings/options as it is.",0,
Now our experimental setup is ready.,0,
Run Wireshark and click on the first icon (List the available capture interfaces …).,0,
Now we see a pop up window that shows Capture Interfaces.,0,
See the snapshots as follows.The number and types of interfaces shown in Capture Interfaces window can be different for you depending on your PC’s configuration.,0,
For me it shows two interfaces and my Internet connection is through Broadcom Gigabit Interface.,0,
So choose the interface through which your Internet connection is available to you.,0,
Now let’s click on the Options button of this interface.,0,
Now we see a new window named Capture Options.,0,
"In this window, type “port 80” in text field named Capture Filter.",0,
See the following snapshot for clarification.Now we are ready to capture the packets passing through our NIC.,0,
"By setting the filter to “port 80”, we have instructed Wireshark to capture only those packets that are because of http traffic (remember that we were always told that the default http port is 80!).",0,
Now click on the Start button on Capture Options window.,0,
You may see some packets in Wireshark if any program in your PC is accessing http traffic in the background; let’s not focus on that.,0,
Now open your browser and try to access http://google.com and now you should be seeing lot many packets getting captured in Wireshark.,0,
See the snapshot as follows.Let’s start analyzing the captured packets.,0,
"First of all, find the first instance of http packet that has   GET / HTTP/1.1 in its Info field.",0,
"In the above snapshot, it’s shown in blue.",0,
"If we take a closer look, we see that this packet has the headers of the all the 5 layers of the Internet Protocol stack.Layer 1 – It is the Physical layer.",0,
Here Frames are shown at the physical layer.Layer 2 – It is the Data Link layer.,0,
"In this packet, we can see that Ethernet II is used as data link layer protocol.",0,
We can find the MAC address of the source and destination in this header.Layer 3 – It is the Network layer.,0,
"In this packet, we see that IP is used as Network layer protocol.",0,
We can see the source and destination IP in this header.Layer 4 – It is the Transport layer.,0,
"In this packet, TCP is used as Transport layer protocol.",0,
We can find the source and destination ports in this header.Layer 5 – It is the Application layer.,0,
"In this packet, HTTP is used as Application layer protocol.Let’s explore one of the layers.",0,
Other layers can be explored further in the similar fashion.,0,
If we expand the Layer 5 i.e.,0,
"HTTP header, it looks as follows.Here we see that Host is mentioned as google.com that is what we tried to access from browser.",1,
User Agent field of the HTTP header shows the browser details.,0,
"In my case, it is Mozilla Firefox as evidenced from this header.",0,
Destination IP 64.233.187.99 should be one of the IP addresses assigned to Google server where the web server is hosted.,0,
It can be verified using a very handy utility command “nslookup”.,0,
"The details of the other fields can be explored in the headers of the HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet II protocols.",0,
"Some of the interesting fields are – Differentiated Services Field (also known as QoS field) in IP header, Window size in TCP header etc.So we have seen that all those rhetorical concepts of layers etc.",0,
do exist in real networks also.,0,
And it sounds interesting when you dissect all the packets that pass through your interface card.,0,
"By doing so, you can get to know what goes/comes through your PC!The idea of this experiment is to provide a conducive platform so that you can explore your own the exciting world of Networking.",0,

Prerequisite : Basics of Computer NetworkingOSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.,0,
"It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization of Standardization‘, in the year 1984.",0,
It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform.,0,
All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.,0,
1,0,
Physical Layer (Layer 1) : The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer.,1,
It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.,0.5,
The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.,1,
It is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.,0.5,
"When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together.The functions of the physical layer are :Bit synchronization: The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock.",1,
This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at bit level.Bit rate control: The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e.,1,
"the number of bits sent per second.Physical topologies: Physical layer specifies the way in which the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e.",1,
"bus, star or mesh topolgy.",0,
Transmission mode: Physical layer also defines the way in which the data flows between the two connected devices.,1,
"The various transmission modes possible are: Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex.",0,
"* Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are Physical Layer devices.",0,
"** Network Layer, Data Link Layer and Physical Layer are also known as Lower Layers or Hardware Layers.2.",0,
Data Link Layer (DLL) (Layer 2) :The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message.,1,
"The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer.",0.5,
"When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address.Data Link Layer is divided into two sub layers :Logical Link Control (LLC)Media Access Control (MAC)The packet received from Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of NIC(Network Interface Card).",0,
DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver’s MAC address in the header.The Receiver’s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) request onto the wire asking “Who has that IP address?” and the destination host will reply with its MAC address.The functions of the data Link layer are : Framing: Framing is a function of the data link layer.,1,
It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver.,0.5,
This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the bexampleinning and end of the frame.,0,
"Physical addressing: After creating frames, Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC address) of sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.",1,
Error control: Data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.,1,
"Flow Control: The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus , flow control coordinates that amount of data that can be sent before receiving acknowledgement.",1,
"Access control: When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, MAC sub-layer of data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.",1,
* Packet in Data Link layer is referred as Frame.,0,
** Data Link layer is handled by the NIC (Network Interface Card) and device drivers of host machines.,0,
*** Switch & Bridge are Data Link Layer devices.3.,0,
Network Layer (Layer 3) :Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks.,1,
It also takes care of packet routing i.e.,0.5,
"selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available.",0.5,
The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by the network layer.The functions of the Network layer are :Routing: The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination.,1,
"This function of network layer is known as routing.Logical Addressing: In order to identify each device on internetwork uniquely, network layer defines an addressing scheme.",1,
The sender & receiver’s IP address are placed in the header by network layer.,0,
Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.,0,
* Sexamplement in Network layer is referred as Packet.,0,
** Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as routers.4.,0,
Transport Layer (Layer 4) :Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes services from network layer.,1,
The data in the transport layer is referred to as Sexamplements.,1,
It is responsible for the End to End Delivery of the complete message.,0.5,
"The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.• At sender’s side: Transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs Sexamplementation and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data transmission.",1,
"It also adds Source and Destination port number in its header and forwards the sexamplemented data to the Network Layer.Note: The sender need to know the port number associated with the receiver’s application.Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually.",1,
"For example, when a web application makes a request to a web server, it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications.",0,
Many applications have default port assigned.• At receiver’s side: Transport Layer reads the port number from its header and forwards the Data which it has received to the respective application.,0,
"It also performs sequencing and reassembling of the sexamplemented data.The functions of the transport layer are :Sexamplementation and Reassembly: This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer , breaks the message into smaller units .",0.5,
Each of the sexamplement produced has a header associated with it.,0,
"The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.Service Point Addressing: In order to deliver the message to correct process, transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address or port address.",1,
"Thus by specifying this address, transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.The services provided by the transport layer :Connection Oriented Service: It is a three-phase process which include– Connection Establishment– Data Transfer– Termination / disconnectionIn this type of transmission, the receiving device sends an acknowledgement, back to the source after a packet or group of packet is received.",1,
This type of transmission is reliable and secure.Connection less service: It is a one-phase process and includes Data Transfer.,0,
"In this type of transmission, the receiver does not acknowledge receipt of a packet.",0,
This approach allows for much faster communication between devices.,0,
Connection-oriented service is more reliable than connectionless Service.,0,
* Data in the Transport Layer is called as Sexamplements.,0,
** Transport layer is operated by the Operating System.,0,
It is a part of the OS and communicates with the Application Layer by making system calls.Transport Layer is called as Heart of OSI model.5.,0,
"Session Layer (Layer 5) :This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.The functions of the session layer are : Session establishment, maintenance and termination: The layer allows the two processes to establish, use and terminate a connection.",1,
Synchronization : This layer allows a process to add checkpoints which are considered as synchronization points into the data.,1,
"These synchronization point help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely and data loss is avoided.",0,
Dialog Controller : The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full-duplex.,1,
**All the below 3 layers(including Session Layer) are intexamplerated as a single layer in the TCP/IP model as “Application Layer”.,0,
**Implementation of these 3 layers is done by the network application itself.,0,
These are also known as Upper Layers or Software Layers.SCENARIO:Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to send a message through some Messenger application running in his browser.,0,
The “Messenger” here acts as the application layer which provides the user with an interface to create the data.,0,
"This message or so-called Data is compressed, encrypted (if any secure data) and converted into bits (0’s and 1’s) so that it can be transmitted.6.",0,
"Presentation Layer (Layer 6) :Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.The functions of the presentation layer are :Translation : For example, ASCII to EBCDIC.",1,
Encryption/ Decryption : Data encryption translates the data into another form or code.,1,
The encrypted data is known as the cipher text and the decrypted data is known as plain text.,0,
A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.,0,
Compression: Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.7.,1,
"Application Layer (Layer 7) :At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications.",1,
"These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network.",1,
"This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user.Ex: Application – Browsers, Skype Messenger etc.",0.5,
**Application Layer is also called as Desktop Layer.,0,
The functions of the Application layer are : Network Virtual Terminal FTAM-File transfer access and management Mail Services Directory Services OSI model acts as a reference model and is not implemented in the Internet because of its late invention.,0,
Current model being used is the TCP/IP model.,0,
Prerequisite – Layers of OSI ModelThe OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model.,0,
It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components.,0,
"But when we talk about the TCP/IP model, it was designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and is based on standard protocols.",0,
It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.,0,
The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model.,1,
"It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model.",0,
"The layers are: Process/Application LayerHost-to-Host/Transport LayerInternet LayerNetwork Access/Link LayerThe diagrammatic comparison of the TCP/IP and OSI model is as follows :Difference between TCP/IP and OSI Model:TCP/IPOSITCP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection.TCP/IP has 4 layers.OSI has 7 layers.TCP/IP is more reliable OSI is less reliableTCP/IP does not have very strict boundaries.OSI has strict boundariesTCP/IP follow a horizontal approach.OSI follows a vertical approach.TCP/IP uses both session and presentation layer in the application layer itself.OSI uses different session and presentation layers.TCP/IP developed protocols then model.OSI developed model then protocol.Transport layer in TCP/IP does not provide assurance delivery of packets.In OSI model, transport layer provides assurance delivery of packets.TCP/IP model network layer only provides connection less services.Connection less and connection oriented both services are provided by network layer in OSI model.Protocols cannot be replaced easily in TCP/IP model.While in OSI model, Protocols are better covered and is easy to replace with the change in technology.The first layer is the Process layer on the behalf of the sender and Network Access layer on the behalf of the receiver.",1,
"During this article, we will be talking on the behalf of the receiver.1.",0,
Network Access Layer –This layer corresponds to the combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model.,1,
"It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.We just talked about ARP being a protocol of Internet layer, but there is a conflict about declaring it as a protocol of Internet Layer or Network access layer.",0.5,
"It is described as residing in layer 3, being encapsulated by layer 2 protocols.2.",0,
Internet Layer –This layer parallels the functions of OSI’s Network layer.,1,
It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network.,0,
The main protocols residing at this layer are :IP – stands for Internet Protocol and it is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host by looking at the IP addresses in the packet headers.,0.5,
IP has 2 versions:IPv4 and IPv6.,1,
IPv4 is the one that most of the websites are using currently.,1,
But IPv6 is growing as the number of IPv4 addresses are limited in number when compared to the number of users.ICMP – stands for Internet Control Message Protocol.,1,
It is encapsulated within IP datagrams and is responsible for providing hosts with information about network problems.ARP – stands for Address Resolution Protocol.,0,
Its job is to find the hardware address of a host from a known IP address.,0,
"ARP has several types: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP and Inverse ARP.",0,
3,0,
Host-to-Host Layer –This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model.,1,
It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data.,0.5,
It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data.,0.5,
The two main protocols present in this layer are :Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) – It is known to provide reliable and error-free communication between end systems.,0,
It performs sequencing and sexamplementation of data.,0.5,
It also has acknowledgment feature and controls the flow of the data through flow control mechanism.,0,
It is a very effective protocol but has a lot of overhead due to such features.,0,
Increased overhead leads to increased cost.User Datagram Protocol (UDP) – On the other hand does not provide any such features.,0,
It is the go-to protocol if your application does not require reliable transport as it is very cost-effective.,0,
"Unlike TCP, which is connection-oriented protocol, UDP is connectionless.4.",0,
"Application Layer – This layer performs the functions of top three layers of the OSI model: Application, Presentation and Session Layer.",1,
It is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications.,0.5,
"Some of the protocols present in this layer are: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, SNMP, NTP, DNS, DHCP, NFS, X Window, LPD.",0,
Have a look at Protocols in Application Layer for some information about these protocols.,0,
Protocols other than those present in the linked article are : HTTP and HTTPS – HTTP stands for Hypertext transfer protocol.,0,
It is used by the World Wide Web to manage communications between web browsers and servers.,0,
HTTPS stands for HTTP-Secure.,1,
It is a combination of HTTP with SSL(Secure Socket Layer).,1,
"It is efficient in cases where the browser need to fill out forms, sign in, authenticate and carry out bank transactions.SSH – SSH stands for Secure Shell.",0,
It is a terminal emulations software similar to Telnet.,0,
The reason SSH is more preferred is because of its ability to maintain the encrypted connection.,1,
It sets up a secure session over a TCP/IP connection.NTP – NTP stands for Network Time Protocol.,0,
It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source.,0,
It is very useful in situations like bank transactions.,0,
Assume the following situation without the presence of NTP.,0,
"Suppose you carry out a transaction, where your computer reads the time at 2:30 PM while the server records it at 2:28 PM.",0,
The server can crash very badly if it’s out of sync.,0,
Compiler is a software which converts a program written in high level language (Source Language) to low level language (Object/Target/Machine Language).Cross Compiler that runs on a machine ‘A’ and produces a code for another machine ‘B’.,1,
It is capable of creating code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running.Source-to-source Compiler or transcompiler or transpiler is a compiler that translates source code written in one programming language into source code of another programming language.Language processing systems (using Compiler) –We know a computer is a logical assembly of Software and Hardware.,1,
"The hardware knows a language, that is hard for us to grasp, consequently we tend to write programs in high-level language, that is much less complicated for us to comprehend and maintain in thoughts.",1,
Now these programs go through a series of transformation so that they can readily be used machines.,0,
This is where language procedure systems come handy.High Level Language – If a program contains #define or #include directives such as #include or #define it is called HLL.,0,
They are closer to humans but far from machines.,0,
These (#) tags are called pre-processor directives.,1,
They direct the pre-processor about what to do.Pre-Processor – The pre-processor removes all the #include directives by including the files called file inclusion and all the #define directives using macro expansion.,0.5,
"It performs file inclusion, augmentation, macro-processing etc.Assembly Language – Its neither in binary form nor high level.",0.5,
It is an intermediate state that is a combination of machine instructions and some other useful data needed for execution.Assembler – For every platform (Hardware + OS) we will have a assembler.,0.5,
They are not universal since for each platform we have one.,0,
The output of assembler is called object file.,1,
Its translates assembly language to machine code.,0,
"Interpreter – An interpreter converts high level language into low level machine language, just like a compiler.",1,
But they are different in the way they read the input.,0,
"The Compiler in one go reads the inputs, does the processing and executes the source code whereas the interpreter does the same line by line.",1,
Compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code whereas an interpreter translates the program one statement at a time.,1,
Interpreted programs are usually slower with respect to compiled ones.Relocatable Machine Code – It can be loaded at any point and can be run.,1,
The address within the program will be in such a way that it will cooperate for the program movement.Loader/Linker – It converts the relocatable code into absolute code and tries to run the program resulting in a running program or an error message (or sometimes both can happen).,1,
Linker loads a variety of object files into a single file to make it executable.,1,
"Then loader loads it in memory and executes it.Phases of a Compiler –There are two major phases of compilation, which in turn have many parts.",1,
"Each of them take input from the output of the previous level and work in a coordinated way.Analysis Phase – An intermediate representation is created from the give source code :Lexical AnalyzerSyntax AnalyzerSemantic AnalyzerIntermediate Code GeneratorLexical analyzer divides the program into “tokens”, Syntax analyzer recognizes “sentences” in the program using syntax of language and Semantic analyzer checks static semantics of each construct.",1,
Intermediate Code Generator generates “abstract” code.Synthesis Phase – Equivalent target program is created from the intermediate representation.,1,
"It has two parts :Code OptimizerCode GeneratorCode Optimizer optimizes the abstract code, and final Code Generator translates abstract intermediate code into specific machine instructions.GATE CS Corner QuestionsPracticing the following questions will help you test your knowledge.",1,
All questions have been asked in GATE in previous years or in GATE Mock Tests.,0,

"Prerequisite – Introduction of Compiler designWe basically have two phases of compilers, namely Analysis phase and Synthesis phase.",0,
Analysis phase creates an intermediate representation from the given source code.,0,
"Synthesis phase creates an equivalent target program from the intermediate representation.Symbol Table – It is a data structure being used and maintained by the compiler, consists all the identifier’s name along with their types.",1,
It helps the compiler to function smoothly by finding the identifiers quickly.,0.5,
The analysis of a source program is divided into mainly three phases.,0,
They are:Linear Analysis-This involves a scanning phase where the stream of characters are read from left to right.,1,
"It is then then grouped into various tokens having a collective meaning.Hierarchical Analysis-In this analysis phase,based on a collective meaning, the tokens are catexampleorized hierarchically into nested groups.Semantic Analysis-This phase is used to check whether the components of the source program are meaningful or not.The compiler has two modules namely front end and back end.",1,
"Front-end constitutes of the Lexical analyzer, semantic analyzer, syntax analyzer and intermediate code generator.",0,
And the rest are assembled to form the back end.Lexical Analyzer –It is also called scanner.,0,
It takes the output of preprocessor (which performs file inclusion and macro expansion) as the input which is in pure high level language.,0,
It reads the characters from source program and groups them into lexemes (sequence of characters that “go together”).,0,
Each lexeme corresponds to a token.,0,
Tokens are defined by rexampleular expressions which are understood by the lexical analyzer.,1,
"It also removes lexical errors (for example, erroneous characters), comments and white space.Syntax Analyzer – It is sometimes called as parser.",0.5,
It constructs the parse tree.,0,
It takes all the tokens one by one and uses Context Free Grammar to construct the parse tree.Why Grammar ?The rules of programming can be entirely represented in some few productions.,0.5,
Using these productions we can represent what the program actually is.,0,
The input has to be checked whether it is in the desired format or not.The parse tree is also called the derivation tree.Parse trees are generally constructed to check for ambiguity in the given grammar.,1,
There are certain rules associated with the derivation tree.Any identifier is an expressionAny number can be called an expressionPerforming any operations in the given expression will always result in an expression.,0,
"For example,the sum of two expressions is also an expression.The parse tree can be compressed to form a syntax treeSyntax error can be detected at this level if the input is not in accordance with the grammar.Semantic Analyzer – It verifies the parse tree, whether it’s meaningful or not.",1,
It furthermore produces a verified parse tree.,0,
"It also does type checking, Label checking and Flow control checking.Intermediate Code Generator – It generates intermediate code, that is a form which can be readily executed by machine We have many popular intermediate codes.",0,
Example – Three address code etc.,0,
"Intermediate code is converted to machine language using the last two phases which are platform dependent.Till intermediate code, it is same for every compiler out there, but after that, it depends on the platform.",1,
To build a new compiler we don’t need to build it from scratch.,0,
We can take the intermediate code from the already existing compiler and build the last two parts.,0,
Code Optimizer – It transforms the code so that it consumes fewer resources and produces more speed.,1,
The meaning of the code being transformed is not altered.,0,
Optimisation can be catexampleorized into two types: machine dependent and machine independent.,1,
"Target Code Generator – The main purpose of Target Code generator is to write a code that the machine can understand and also rexampleister allocation, instruction selection etc.",1,
The output is dependent on the type of assembler.,0,
This is the final stage of compilation.,0,
The optimized code is converted into relocatable machine code which then forms the input to the linker and loader.All these six phases are associated with the symbol table manager and error handler as shown in the above block diagram.Attention reader!,1,

Prerequisite – Phases of a CompilerSymbol Table is an important data structure created and maintained by the compiler in order to keep track of semantics of variable i.e.,0,
"it stores information about scope and binding information about names, information about instances of various entities such as variable and function names, classes, objects, etc.It is built in lexical and syntax analysis phases.The information is collected by the analysis phases of compiler and is used by synthesis phases of compiler to generate code.It is used by compiler to achieve compile time efficiency.It is used by various phases of compiler as follows :-Lexical Analysis: Creates new table entries in the table, example like entries about token.Syntax Analysis: Adds information rexamplearding attribute type, scope, dimension, line of reference, use, etc in the table.Semantic Analysis: Uses available information in the table to check for semantics i.e.",1,
"to verify that expressions and assignments are semantically correct(type checking) and update it accordingly.Intermediate Code generation: Refers symbol table for knowing how much and what type of run-time is allocated and table helps in adding temporary variable information.Code Optimization: Uses information present in symbol table for machine dependent optimization.Target Code generation: Generates code by using address information of identifier present in the table.Symbol Table entries – Each entry in symbol table is associated with attributes that support compiler in different phases.Items stored in Symbol table:Variable names and constantsProcedure and function namesLiteral constants and stringsCompiler generated temporariesLabels in source languagesInformation used by compiler from Symbol table:Data type and nameDeclaring proceduresOffset in storageIf structure or record then, pointer to structure table.For parameters, whether parameter passing by value or by referenceNumber and type of arguments passed to function Base AddressOperations of Symbol table – The basic operations defined on a symbol table include:Implementation of Symbol table –Following are commonly used data structure for implementing symbol table :-List –In this method, an array is used to store names and associated information.A pointer “available” is maintained at end of all stored records and new names are added in the order as they arrive To search for a name we start from bexampleinning of list till available pointer and if not found we get an error “use of undeclared name”While inserting a new name we must ensure that it is not already present otherwise error occurs i.e.",1,
"“Multiple defined name”Insertion is fast O(1), but lookup is slow for large tables – O(n) on averageAdvantage is that it takes minimum amount of space.Linked List –This implementation is using linked list.",1,
"A link field is added to each record.Searching of names is done in order pointed by link of link field.A pointer “First” is maintained to point to first record of symbol table.Insertion is fast O(1), but lookup is slow for large tables – O(n) on averageHash Table –In hashing scheme two tables are maintained – a hash table and symbol table and is the most commonly used method to implement symbol tables..A hash table is an array with index range: 0 to tablesize – 1.These entries are pointer pointing to names of symbol table.To search for a name we use hash function that will result in any intexampleer between 0 to tablesize – 1.Insertion and lookup can be made very fast – O(1).Advantage is quick search is possible and disadvantage is that hashing is complicated to implement.Binary Search Tree –Another approach to implement symbol table is to use binary search tree i.e.",1,
we add two link fields i.e.,0,
left and right child.,0,
All names are created as child of root node that always follow the property of binary search tree.Insertion and lookup are O(log2 n) on average.Attention reader!,0,

The scope of a variable x is the rexampleion of the program in which uses of x refers to its declaration.,0,
One of the basic reasons of scoping is to keep variables in different parts of program distinct from one another.,0,
"Since there are only a small number of short variable names, and programmers share habits about naming of variables (example, i for an array index), in any program of moderate size the same variable name will be used in multiple different scopes.Scoping is generally divided into two classes:1.Static Scoping2.Dynamic ScopingStatic Scoping:Static scoping is also called lexical scoping.",1,
In this scoping a variable always refers to its top level environment.,0,
This is a property of the program text and unrelated to the run time call stack.,0,
Static scoping also makes it much easier to make a modular code as programmer can figure out the scope just by looking at the code.,1,
"In contrast, dynamic scope requires the programmer to anticipate all possible dynamic contexts.In most of the programming languages including C, C++ and Java, variables are always statically (or lexically) scoped i.e., binding of a variable can be determined by program text and is independent of the run-time function call stack.",1,
"moreFor example, output for the below program is 10, i.e., the value returned by f() is not dependent on who is calling it (Like g() calls it and has a x with value 20).",0,
"f() always returns the value of global variable x.Output : To sum up in static scoping the compiler first searches in the current block, then in global variables, then in successively smaller scopes.Dynamic Scoping:With dynamic scope, a global identifier refers to the identifier associated with the most recent environment, and is uncommon in modern languages.",0,
"In technical terms, this means that each identifier has a global stack of bindings and the occurrence of a identifier is searched in the most recent binding.",0,
"In simpler terms, in dynamic scoping the compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.Output in a a language that uses Dynamic Scoping : Static Vs Dynamic ScopingIn most of the programming languages static scoping is dominant.",1,
This is simply because in static scoping it’s easy to reason about and understand just by looking at code.,0,
"We can see what variables are in the scope just by looking at the text in the editor.Dynamic scoping does not care how the code is written, but instead how it executes.",0,
"Each time a new function is executed, a new scope is pushed onto the stack.Perl supports both dynamic ans static scoping.",0,
"Perl’s keyword “my” defines a statically scoped local variable, while the keyword “local” defines dynamically scoped local variable.",0,
Output :,0,
"There are five generation of Programming languages.They are:First Generation Languages :These are low-level languages like machine language.Second Generation Languages :These are low-level assembly languages used in kernels and hardware drives.Third Generation Languages :These are high-level languages like C, C++, Java, Visual Basic and JavaScript.Fourth Generation Languages :These are languages that consist of statements that are similar to statements in the human language.",1,
These are used mainly in database programming and scripting.,0,
"Example of these languages include Perl, Python, Ruby, SQL, MatLab(MatrixLaboratory).Fifth Generation Languages :These are the programming languages that have visual tools to develop a program.",0,
"Examples of fifth generation language include Mercury, OPS5, and Prolog.The first two generations are called low level languages.",0,
The next three generations are called high level languages.,0,
"The tasks of the Error Handling process are to detect each error, report it to the user, and then make some recover stratexampley and implement them to handle error.",0,
During this whole process processing time of program should not be slow.,0,
"An Error is the blank entries in the symbol table.Types or Sources of Error – There are two types of error: run-time and compile-time error:A run-time error is an error which takes place during the execution of a program, and usually happens because of adverse system parameters or invalid input data.",1,
The lack of sufficient memory to run an application or a memory conflict with another program and logical error are example of this.,1,
"Logic errors, occur when executed code does not produce the expected result.",0,
"Logic errors are best handled by meticulous program debugging.Compile-time errors rises at compile time, before execution of the program.",0,
Syntax error or missing file reference that prevents the program from successfully compiling is the example of this.,0,
"Classification of Compile-time error –Lexical : This includes misspellings of identifiers, keywords or operatorsSyntactical : missing semicolon or unbalanced parenthesisSemantical : incompatible value assignment or type mismatches between operator and operandLogical : code not reachable, infinite loop.Finding error or reporting an error – Viable-prefix is the property of a parser which allows early detection of syntax errors.Goal: detection of an error as soon as possible without further consuming unnecessary inputHow: detect an error as soon as the prefix of the input does not match a prefix of any string in thelanguage.Example: for(;), this will report an error as for have two semicolons inside braces.Error Recovery –The basic requirement for the compiler is to simply stop and issue a message, and cease compilation.",1,
"There are some common recovery methods that are follows.Panic mode recovery: This is the easiest way of error-recovery and also, it prevents the parser from developing infinite loops while recovering error.",1,
"The parser discards the input symbol one at a time until one of the designated (like end, semicolon) set of synchronizing tokens (are typically the statement or expression terminators) is found.",1,
This is adequate when the presence of multiple errors in same statement is rare.,0,
Example: Consider the erroneous expression- (1 + + 2) + 3.,0,
Panic-mode recovery: Skip ahead to next intexampleer and then continue.,0,
Bison: use the special terminal error to describe how much input to skip.Phase level recovery: Perform local correction on the input to repair the error.,0,
But error correction is difficult in this stratexampley.Error productions: Some common errors are known to the compiler designers that may occur in the code.,0,
"Augmented grammars can also be used, as productions that generate erroneous constructs when these errors are encountered.",0,
Example: write 5x instead of 5*xGlobal correction: Its aim is to make as few changes as possible while converting an incorrect input string to a valid string.,0,
This stratexampley is costly to implement.Next related article – Error detection and Recovery in CompilerAttention reader!,0,

This process of locating errors and reporting it to user is called Error Handling process.Functions of Error handlerDetectionReportingRecoveryClassification of ErrorsCompile time errors are of three types:-Lexical phase errorsThese errors are detected during the lexical analysis phase.,0,
"Typical lexical errors are Exceeding length of identifier or numeric constants.Appearance of illexampleal charactersUnmatched stringError recovery:Panic Mode RecoveryIn this method, successive characters from the input are removed one at a time until a designated set of synchronizing tokens is found.",1,

Typical syntax errors are Errors in structureMissing operatorMisspelled keywordsUnbalanced parenthesisThe keyword switch is incorrectly written as swicth.,0,
"Hence, “Unidentified keyword/identifier” error occurs.Error recovery: Panic Mode RecoveryIn this method, successive characters from input are removed one at a time until a designated set of synchronizing tokens is found.",0,
"Synchronizing tokens are deli-meters such as ; or }Advantage is that its easy to implement and guarantees not to go to infinite loopDisadvantage is that a considerable amount of input is skipped without checking it for additional errorsStatement Mode recoveryIn this method, when a parser encounters an error, it performs necessary correction on remaining input so that the rest of input statement allow the parser to parse ahead.The correction can be deletion of extra semicolons, replacing comma by semicolon or inserting missing semicolon.While performing correction, atmost care should be taken for not going in infinite loop.Disadvantage is that it finds difficult to handle situations where actual error occured before point of detection.Error productionIf user has knowledge of common errors that can be encountered then, these errors can be incorporated by augmenting the grammar with error productions that generate erroneous constructs.If this is used then, during parsing appropriate error messages can be generated and parsing can be continued.Disadvantage is that its difficult to maintain.Global CorrectionThe parser examines the whole program and tries to find out the closest match for it which is error free.The closest match program has less number of insertions, deletions and changes of tokens to recover from erroneous input.Due to high time and space complexity, this method is not implemented practically.Semantic errorsThese errors are detected during semantic analysis phase.",1,
"Typical semantic errors are Incompatible type of operandsUndeclared variablesNot matching of actual arguments with formal oneIt generates a semantic error because of an incompatible type of a and b.Error recoveryIf error “Undeclared Identifier” is encountered then, to recover from this a symbol table entry for corresponding identifier is made.If data types of two operands are incompatible then, automatic type conversion is done by the compiler.Attention reader!",1,

"Let assume that, you have a c program, then you give the C program to compiler and compiler will produce the output in assembly code.Now, that assembly language code will give to the assembler and assembler is going to produce you some code.",0,
"That is known as Object Code.But, when you compile a program, then you are not going to use both compiler and assembler.You just take the program and give it to the compiler and compiler will give you the directly executable code.",0,
The compiler is actually combined inside the assembler along with loader and linker.So all the module kept together in the compiler software itself.,0,

Prerequisite – Introduction of Compiler designLinker is a program in a system which helps to link a object modules of program into a single object file.,0,
It performs the process of linking.,0.5,
Linker are also called link editors.,1,
Linking is process of collecting and maintaining piece of code and data into a single file.,1,
Linker also link a particular module into system library.,1,
It takes object modules from assembler as input and forms an executable file as output for loader.,1,
"Linking is performed at both compile time, when the source code is translated into machine code and load time, when the program is loaded into memory by the loader.",1,
Linking is performed at the last step in compiling a program.,0,
Source code -> compiler -> Assembler -> Object code -> Linker -> Executable file -> Loader Linking is of two types:1.,0,
Static Linking –It is performed during the compilation of source program.,0,
Linking is performed before execution in static linking.,1,
It takes collection of relocatable object file and command-line argument and generate fully linked object file that can be loaded and run.Static linker perform two major task:Symbol resolution – It associates each symbol reference with exactly one symbol definition .Every symbol have predefined task.Relocation – It relocate code and data section and modify symbol references to the relocated memory location.The linker copy all library routines used in the program into executable image.,1,
"As a result, it require more memory space.",0,
As it does not require the presence of library on the system when it is run .,0,
"so, it is faster and more portable.",0,
No failure chance and less error chance.2.,0,
Dynamic linking – Dynamic linking is performed during the run time.,1,
This linking is accomplished by placing the name of a shareable library in the executable image.,0.5,
There is more chances of error and failure chances.,0,
It require less memory space as multiple program can share a single copy of the library.Here we can perform code sharing.,0.5,
it means we are using a same object a number of times in the program.,0,
"Instead of linking same object again and again into the library, each module share information of a object with other module having same object.",1,
The shared library needed in the linking is stored in virtual memory to save RAM.,0,
In this linking we can also relocate the code for the smooth running of code but all the code is not relocatable.It fixes the address at run time.Attention reader!,0,

"There can be easier way to sort out this problem:moreIf the compiler would have come to know in advance, that what is the “first character of the string produced when a production rule is applied”, and comparing it to the current character or token in the input string it sees, it can wisely take decision on which production rule to apply.",1,
"Let’s take the same grammar from the previous article: Thus, in the example above, if it knew that after reading character ‘c’ in the input string and applying S->cAd, next character in the input string is ‘a’, then it would have ignored the production rule A->bc (because ‘b’ is the first character of the string produced by this production rule, not ‘a’ ), and directly use the production rule A->a (because ‘a’ is the first character of the string produced by this production rule, and is same as the current character of the input string which is also ‘a’).Hence it is validated that if the compiler/parser knows about first character of the string that can be obtained by applying a production rule, then it can wisely apply the correct production rule to get the correct syntax tree for the given input string.Why FOLLOW?The parser faces one more problem.",0,
Let us consider below grammar to understand this problem.,0,
"As the first character in the input is a, the parser applies the rule A->aBb.",0,
"Now the parser checks for the second character of the input string which is b, and the Non-Terminal to derive is B, but the parser can’t get any string derivable from B that contains b as first character.But the Grammar does contain a production rule B -> ε, if that is applied then B will vanish, and the parser gets the input “ab” , as shown below.",0,
But the parser can apply it only when it knows that the character that follows B in the production rule is same as the current character in the input.,0,
"In RHS of A -> aBb, b follows Non-Terminal B, i.e.",0,
"FOLLOW(B) = {b}, and the current input character read is also b.",0,
Hence the parser applies this rule.,0,
And it is able to get the string “ab” from the given grammar.So FOLLOW can make a Non-terminal to vanish out if needed to generate the string from the parse tree.,0,
"The conclusions is, we need to find FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar, so that the parser can properly apply the needed rule at the correct position.In the next article, we will discus formal definitions of FIRST and FOLLOW, and some easy rules to compute these sets.Quiz on Syntax AnalysisThis article is compiled by Vaibhav Bajpai.",0,

Prerequisite – Parsing | Set 2 (Bottom Up or Shift Reduce Parsers)Shift Reduce parser attempts for the construction of parse in a similar manner as done in bottom up parsing i.e.,1,
the parse tree is constructed from leaves(bottom) to the root(up).,1,
"A more general form of shift reduce parser is LR parser.This parser requires some data structures i.e.A input buffer for storing the input string.A stack for storing and accessing the production rules.Basic Operations –Shift: This involves moving of symbols from input buffer onto the stack.Reduce: If the handle appears on top of the stack then, its reduction by using appropriate production rule is done i.e.",0,
"RHS of production rule is popped out of stack and LHS of production rule is pushed onto the stack.Accept: If only start symbol is present in the stack and the input buffer is empty then, the parsing action is called accept.",1,
"When accept action is obtained, it is means successful parsing is done.Error: This is the situation in which the parser can neither perform shift action nor reduce action and not even accept action.Example 1 – Consider the grammar         S –> S + S         S –> S * S         S –> id Perform Shift Reduce parsing for input string “id + id + id”.",0,

There are three types of process scheduler.,0,
It brings the new process to the ‘Ready State’.,0,
"It controls , i.e., number of process present in ready state at any point of time.It is important that the long-term scheduler make a careful selection of both IO and CPU bound process.",0,
It is responsible for selecting one process from ready state for scheduling it on the running state.,0,
Note: Short-term scheduler only selects the process to schedule it doesn’t load the process on running.,0,
is responsible for loading the process selected by Short-term scheduler on the CPU (Ready to Running State) Context switching is done by dispatcher only.,0,
A dispatcher does the following:Switching context.Switching to user mode.Jumping to the proper location in the newly loaded program.,0,
It is responsible for suspending and resuming the process.,0,
It mainly does swapping (moving processes from main memory to disk and vice versa).,0,
"Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix or because a change in memory requirements has overcommitted available memory, requiring memory to be freed up.",0,
Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways.,0,
Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run.,0,
There are three types of Scheduler:Long term (job) scheduler – Due to the smaller size of main memory initially all program are stored in secondary memory.,0,
When they are stored or loaded in the main memory they are called process.,0,
This is the decision of long term scheduler that how many processes will stay in the ready queue.,1,
"Hence, in simple words, long term scheduler decides the degree of multi-programming of system.Medium term scheduler – Most often, a running process needs I/O operation which doesn’t requires CPU.",0,
Hence during the execution of a process when a I/O operation is required then the operating system sends that process from running queue to blocked queue.,0,
When a process completes its I/O operation then it should again be shifted to ready queue.,0,
All these decisions are taken by the medium-term scheduler.,0,
Medium-term scheduling is a part of swapping.Short term (CPU) scheduler – When there are lots of processes in main memory initially all are present in the ready queue.,0,
"Among all of the process, a single process is to be selected for execution.",0,
This decision is handled by short term scheduler.Let’s have a look at the figure given below.,0,
It may make a more clear view for you.Dispatcher –A dispatcher is a special program which comes into play after the scheduler.,0,
"When the scheduler completes its job of selecting a process, it is the dispatcher which takes that process to the desired state/queue.",1,
The dispatcher is the module that gives a process control over the CPU after it has been selected by the short-term scheduler.,1,
"This function involves the following:Switching contextSwitching to user modeJumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that programThe Difference between the Scheduler and Dispatcher –Consider a situation, where various processes are residing in the ready queue waiting to be executed.",0,
"The CPU cannot execute all of these processes simultaneously, so the operating system has to choose a particular process on the basis of the scheduling algorithm used.",0,
"So, this procedure of selecting a process among various processes is done by the scheduler.",1,
"Once the scheduler has selected a process from the queue, the dispatcher comes into the picture, and it is the dispatcher who takes that process from the ready queue and moves it into the running state.",0,
"Therefore, the scheduler gives the dispatcher an ordered list of processes which the dispatcher moves to the CPU over time.",1,
"Example –There are 4 processes in the ready queue, P1, P2, P3, P4; Their arrival times are t0, t1, t2, t3 respectively.",0,
A First in First out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm is used.,0,
"Because P1 arrived first, the scheduler will decide it is the first process that should be executed, and the dispatcher will remove P1 from the ready queue and give it to the CPU.",0,
"The scheduler will then determine P2 to be the next process that should be executed, so when the dispatcher returns to the queue for a new process, it will take P2 and give it to the CPU.",0,
"This continues in the same way for P3, and then P4.",0,
PropertiesDISPATCHERSCHEDULERDefinition:Dispatcher is a module that gives control of CPU to the process selected by short term schedulerScheduler is something which selects a process among various processesTypes:There are no different types in dispatcher.It is just a code segment.There are 3 types of scheduler i.e.,0,
"Long-term, Short-term, Medium-termDependency:Working of dispatcher is dependent on scheduler.Means dispatcher have to wait until scheduler selects a process.Scheduler works independently.",0,
"It works immediately when neededAlgorithm:Dispatcher has no specific algorithm for its implementationScheduler works on various algorithm  such as FCFS, SJF, RR etc.",0,
The time taken by dispatcher is called dispatch latency.,0,
"Time taken by scheduler is usually negligible.Hence we neglect it.Functions:Dispatcher is also responsible for:Context Switching, Switch to user mode, Jumping to proper location when process again restartedThe only work of scheduler is selection of processes.",0,
Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time.Below are different time with respect to a process.,0,
Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.,0,
Time at which process completes its execution.more        Time required by a process for CPU execution.,0,
Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.,0,
Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.,0,
Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time A typical process involves both I/O time and CPU time.,0,
"In a uni programming system like MS-DOS, time spent waiting for I/O is wasted and CPU is free during this time.",1,
"In multi programming systems, one process can use CPU while another is waiting for I/O.",1,
This is possible only with process scheduling.,0,
Max CPU utilization [Keep CPU as busy as possible]Fair allocation of CPU.Max throughput [Number of processes that complete their execution per time unit]Min turnaround time [Time taken by a process to finish execution]Min waiting time [Time a process waits in ready queue]Min response time [Time when a process produces first response]  Simplest scheduling algorithm that schedules according to arrival times of processes.,0,
First come first serve scheduling algorithm states that the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.,0,
It is implemented by using the FIFO queue.,0,
"When a process enters the ready queue, its PCB is linked onto the tail of the queue.",0,
"When the CPU is free, it is allocated to the process at the head of the queue.",0,
The running process is then removed from the queue.,0,
FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.First come first serve suffers from convoy effect.,0,
Process which have the shortest burst time are scheduled first.If two processes have the same bust time then FCFS is used to break the tie.,0,
It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.,0,
It is similar to SJF scheduling algorithm.,0,
"But, in this scheduling algorithm, we give priority to the process having the longest burst time.",0,
"This is non-preemptive in nature i.e., when any process starts executing, can’t be interrupted before complete execution.",0,
It is preemptive mode of SJF algorithm in which jobs are schedule according to shortest remaining time.,0,
It is preemptive mode of LJF algorithm in which we give priority to the process having largest burst time remaining.,0,
Each process is assigned a fixed time(Time Quantum/Time Slice) in cyclic way.It is designed especially for the time-sharing system.,0,
The ready queue is treated as a circular queue.,0,
"The CPU scheduler goes around the ready queue, allocating the CPU to each process for a time interval of up to 1-time quantum.",1,
"To implement Round Robin scheduling, we keep the ready queue as a FIFO queue of processes.",1,
New processes are added to the tail of the ready queue.,0,
"The CPU scheduler picks the first process from the ready queue, sets a timer to interrupt after 1-time quantum, and dispatches the process.",1,
One of two things will then happen.,0,
The process may have a CPU burst of less than 1-time quantum.,0,
"In this case, the process itself will release the CPU voluntarily.",0,
The scheduler will then proceed to the next process in the ready queue.,0,
"Otherwise, if the CPU burst of the currently running process is longer than 1-time quantum, the timer will go off and will cause an interrupt to the operating system.",0,
"A context switch will be executed, and the process will be put at the tail of the ready queue.",0,
The CPU scheduler will then select the next process in the ready queue.,0,
"In this scheduling, processes are scheduled according to their priorities, i.e., highest priority process is scheduled first.",0,
"If priorities of two processes match, then schedule according to arrival time.",0,
Here starvation of process is possible.,0,
"In this scheduling, processes with highest response ratio is scheduled.",0,
This algorithm avoids starvation.,0,
"According to the priority of process, processes are placed in the different queues.",0,
Generally high priority process are placed in the top level queue.,0,
"Only after completion of processes from top level queue, lower level queued processes are scheduled.",0,
It can suffer from starvation.,0,
It allows the process to move in between queues.,0,
The idea is to separate processes according to the characteristics of their CPU bursts.,0,
"If a process uses too much CPU time, it is moved to a lower-priority queue.",0,
"FCFS can cause long waiting times, especially when the first job takes too much CPU time.",0,
Both SJF and Shortest Remaining time first algorithms may cause starvation.,0,
"Consider a situation when the long process is there in the ready queue and shorter processes keep coming.If time quantum for Round Robin scheduling is very large, then it behaves same as FCFS scheduling.",0,
"SJF is optimal in terms of average waiting time for a given set of processes,i.e., average waiting time is minimum with this scheduling, but problems are, how to know/predict the time of next job.",0,
Consider a system which requires 40-time units of burst time.,0,
"The Multilevel feedback queue scheduling is used and time quantum is 2 unit for the top queue and is incremented by 5 unit at each level, then in what queue the process will terminate the execution?",0,

"Consider the following table of arrival time and burst time for three processes P0, P1 and P2.",0,
(GATE-CS-2011)The pre-emptive shortest job first scheduling algorithm is used.,0,
Scheduling is carried out only at arrival or completion of processes.,0,
What is the average waiting time for the three processes?,0,
(A) 5.0 ms(B) 4.33 ms(C) 6.33(D) 7.33Solution :Answer: – (A)Process P0 is allocated processor at 0 ms as there is no other process in the ready queue.,0,
P0 is preempted after 1 ms as P1 arrives at 1 ms and burst time for P1 is less than remaining time of P0.,0,
P1 runs for 4ms.,0,
P2 arrived at 2 ms but P1 continued as burst time of P2 is longer than P1.,0,
"After P1 completes, P0 is scheduled again as the remaining time for P0 is less than the burst time of P2.P0 waits for 4 ms, P1 waits for 0 ms and P2 waits for 11 ms.",0,
So average waiting time is (0+4+11)/3 = 5.,0,

"An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file,process, and memory.",0,
"Thus operating system acts as manager of all the resources, i.e.",0,
Thus operating system becomes an interface between user and machine.,1,
Some of the widely used operating systems are as follows-This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly.,0,
There is an operator which takes similar jobs having same requirement and group them into batches.,0,
It is the responsibility of operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.,0,

The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails,0,
"Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly.",0,
Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system.,0,
These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems.,0,
The task can be from single user or from different users also.,0,
The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum.,1,
"After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.Each task gets an equal opportunity, less chances of duplication of software, CPU idle time can be reduced",0,
"Reliability problem, One must have to take care of security and intexamplerity of user programs and dataData communication problem Multics, Unix etc.These types of operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer technology and are being widely accepted all-over the world and, that too, with a great pace.",0,
Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other using a shared communication network.,0,
Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU.,0,
These are referred as  or distributed systems.,0,
These system’s processors differ in size and function.,0,
"The major benefit of working with these types of operating system is that it is always possible that one user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but on some other system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network.Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent from each otherElectronic mail increases the data exchange speedSince resources are being shared, computation is highly fast and durableLoad on host computer reducesThese systems are easily scalable as many systems can be easily added to the networkDelay in data processing reducesFailure of the main network will stop the entire communicationTo establish distributed systems the language which are used are not well defined yetThese types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive.",0,
"Not only that the underlying software is highly complex and not understood well yet LOCUS etc.These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions.",0,
"These type of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network.",0,
"One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual connections etc.",0,
"and that’s why these computers are popularly known as .Highly stable centralized serversSecurity concerns are handled through serversNew technologies and hardware up-gradation are easily intexamplerated to the systemServer access are possible remotely from different locations and types of systemsServers are costlyUser has to depend on central location for most operationsMaintenance and updates are required rexampleularly Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD etc.These types of OSs serves the real-time systems.",0,
The time interval required to process and respond to inputs is very small.,0,
This time interval is called .,0,
"are used when there are time requirements are very strict like missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots etc.These OSs are meant for the applications where time constraints are very strict and even the shortest possible delay is not acceptable.",0,
These systems are built for saving life like automatic parachutes or air bags which are required to be readily available in case of any accident.,0,
Virtual memory is almost never found in these systems.These OSs are for applications where for time-constraint is less strict.,0,
"Maximum utilization of devices and system,thus more output from all the resources  Time assigned for shifting tasks in these systems are very less.",0,
For example in older systems it takes about 10 micro seconds in shifting one task to another and in latest systems it takes 3 micro seconds.,0,
Focus on running applications and less importance to applications which are in queue.,0,
"Since size of programs are small, RTOS can also be used in embedded systems like in transport and others.",0,
These types of systems are error free.,0,
Memory allocation is best managed in these type of systems.,0,
Very few tasks run at the same time and their concentration is very less on few applications to avoid errors.,0,
Sometimes the system resources are not so good and they are expensive as well.,0,
The algorithms are very complex and difficult for the designer to write on.,0,
It needs specific device drivers and interrupt signals to response earliest to interrupts.,0,
It is not good to set thread priority as these systems are very less prone to switching tasks.,0,
"Scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon systems, robots, air traffic control systems, etc.",0,
An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware.,1,
The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware.,0,
"The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system.Operating System – Definition:An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information.",0,
"The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.Functions of Operating system – Operating system performs three functions:Convenience: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.Efficiency: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.Ability to Evolve: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service.Operating system as User Interface –UserSystem and application programsOperating systemHardwareEvery general-purpose computer consists of the hardware, operating system, system programs, and application programs.",0,
"The hardware consists of memory, CPU, ALU, and I/O devices, peripheral device, and storage device.",1,
"System program consists of compilers, loaders, editors, OS, etc.",1,
"The application program consists of business programs, database programs.",0,
Every computer must have an operating system to run other programs.,0,
The operating system coordinates the use of the hardware among the various system programs and application programs for various users.,0,
It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.,0,
The operating system is a set of special programs that run on a computer system that allows it to work properly.,0,
"It performs basic tasks such as recognizing input from the keyboard, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, sending output to the display screen and controlling peripheral devices.OS is designed to serve two basic purposes:It controls the allocation and use of the computing System’s resources among the various user and tasks.It provides an interface between the computer hardware and the programmer that simplifies and makes feasible for coding, creation, debugging of application programs.The Operating system must support the following tasks.",0,
"The task are:Provides the facilities to create, modification of programs and data files using an editor.Access to the compiler for translating the user program from high level language to machine language.Provide a loader program to move the compiled program code to the computer’s memory for execution.Provide routines that handle the details of I/O programming.I/O System Management –The module that keeps track of the status of devices is called the I/O traffic controller.",0,
Each I/O device has a device handler that resides in a separate process associated with that device.The I/O subsystem consists ofA memory Management component that includes buffering caching and spooling.A general device driver interface.Drivers for specific hardware devices.Assembler –The input to an assembler is an assembly language program.,0,
The output is an object program plus information that enables the loader to prepare the object program for execution.,0,
"At one time, the computer programmer had at his disposal a basic machine that interpreted, through hardware, certain fundamental instructions.",0,
"He would program this computer by writing a series of ones and Zeros (Machine language), place them into the memory of the machine.Compiler",0,
"The High-level languages- examples are FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL and PL/I are processed by compilers and interpreters.",1,
A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and produces a corresponding object program.,1,
An interpreter is a program that appears to execute a source program as if it was machine language.,1,
"The same name (FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.)",0,
is often used to designate both a compiler and its associated language.,0,
A Loader is a routine that loads an object program and prepares it for execution.,1,
"There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating and direct-linking.",1,
"In general, the loader must load, relocate and link the object program.",1,
The loader is a program that places programs into memory and prepares them for execution.,1,
"In a simple loading scheme, the assembler outputs the machine language translation of a program on a secondary device and a loader places it in the core.",0,
The loader places into memory the machine language version of the user’s program and transfers control to it.,0,
"Since the loader program is much smaller than the assembler, those make more core available to the user’s program.History of Operating system – Operating system has been evolving through the years.",0,
Multiprogramming–Batch Operating System - Sequence of jobs in a program on a computer without manual interventions.,0,
Time sharing operating System - allows many users to share the computer resources.,0,
(Max utilization of the resources).,0,
Distributed operating System manages a group of different computers and make appear to be a single computer.,1,
Network operating system- computers running in different operating system can participate in common network (It is used for security purpose).,0,
Real time operating system – meant applications to fix the deadlines.,0,
"Examples of Operating System are – Windows (GUI based, PC), GNU/Linux (Personal, Workstations, ISP, File and print server, Three-tier client/Server), macOS (Macintosh), used for Apple’s personal computers and work stations (MacBook, iMac).Android (Google’s Operating System for smartphones/tablets/smartwatches)iOS (Apple’s OS for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch)",1,
A process is a program in execution.,1,
"when we write a program in C or C++ and compile it, the compiler creates binary code.",1,
The original code and binary code are both programs.,0,
"When we actually run the binary code, it becomes a process.",1,
"A process is an ‘active’ entity, as opposed to a program, which is considered to be a ‘passive’ entity.",1,
"A single program can create many processes when run multiple times; for example, when we open a .exe or binary file multiple times, multiple instances begin",1,
"A Process, sometimes known as the Text Section, also includes the current activity represented by the value of the program counter.",0,
"The Stack contains the temporary data, such as function parameters, returns addresses, and local variables.",1,
Dynamically allocated memory to process during its run time.Refer this for more details on sections.A process has following attributes.All of the above attributes of a process are also known as the.,0,
Every process has its own program control block,1,
All of the above attributes are part of the PCB.,0,
A process is in one of the following states:The process of saving the context of one process and loading the context of another process is known as Context Switching.,0,
"In simple terms, it is like loading and unloading the process from running state to ready state.",0,
When a high-priority process comes to ready state (i.e.,0,
with higher priority than the running process)2.,0,
An Interrupt occurs3.,0,
User and kernel mode switch (It is not necessary though)4.,0,
"Preemptive CPU scheduling used.A mode switch occurs when CPU privilege level is changed, for example when a system call is made or a fault occurs.",0,
The kernel works in more a privileged mode than a standard user task.,0,
"If a user process wants to access things which are only accessible to the kernel, a mode switch must occur.",0,
The currently executing process need not be changed during a mode switch.A mode switch typically occurs for a process context switch to occur.,0,
Only the kernel can cause a context switch.,1,
A CPU-bound process requires more CPU time or spends more time in the running state.,1,
An I/O-bound process requires more I/O time and less CPU time.,1,
An I/O-bound process spends more time in the waiting state.,1,
Which of the following need not necessarily be saved on a context switch between processes?,0,
"(GATE-CS-2000)(A) General purpose registers(B) Translation lookaside buffer(C) Program counter(D) All of the aboveIn a process context switch, the state of the first process must be saved somehow, so that when the scheduler gets back to the execution of the first process, it can restore this state and continue.",0,
"The state of the process includes all the registers that the process may be using, especially the program counter, plus any other operating system-specific data that may be necessary.",1,
A translation look-aside buffer (TLB) is a CPU cache that memory management hardware uses to improve virtual address translation speed.,1,
"A TLB has a fixed number of slots that contain page table entries, which map virtual addresses to physical addresses.",1,
"On a context switch, some TLB entries can become invalid, since the virtual-to-physical mapping is different.",1,
The simplest strategy to deal with this is to completely flush the TLB.,0,
Context switching can occur only in kernel mode.,1,
"States of a process are as following:New (Create) – In this step, the process is about to be created but not yet created, it is the program which is present in secondary memory that will be picked up by OS to create the process.Ready – New -> Ready to run.",0,
"After the creation of a process, the process enters the ready state i.e.",0,
the process is loaded into the main memory.,0,
The process here is ready to run and is waiting to get the CPU time for its execution.,0,
Processes that are ready for execution by the CPU are maintained in a queue for ready processes.,1,
Run – The process is chosen by CPU for execution and the instructions within the process are executed by any one of the available CPU cores.Blocked or wait – Whenever the process requests access to I/O or needs input from the user or needs access to a critical region(the lock for which is already acquired) it enters the blocked or wait state.,0,
The process continues to wait in the main memory and does not require CPU.,0,
Once the I/O operation is completed the process goes to the ready state.Terminated or completed – Process is killed as well as PCB is deleted.Suspend ready – Process that was initially in the ready state but were swapped out of main memory(refer Virtual Memory topic) and placed onto external storage by scheduler are said to be in suspend ready state.,0,
The process will transition back to ready state whenever the process is again brought onto the main memory.Suspend wait or suspend blocked – Similar to suspend ready but uses the process which was performing I/O operation and lack of main memory caused them to move to secondary memory.When work is finished it may go to suspend ready.CPU and IO Bound Processes:If the process is intensive in terms of CPU operations then it is called CPU bound process.,0,
"Similarly, If the process is intensive in terms of I/O operations then it is called IO bound process.Types of schedulers:Long term – performance – Makes a decision about how many processes should be made to stay in the ready state, this decides the degree of multiprogramming.",0,
Once a decision is taken it lasts for a long time hence called long term scheduler.Short term – Context switching time – Short term scheduler will decide which process to be executed next and then it will call dispatcher.,0,
A dispatcher is a software that moves process from ready to run and vice versa.,1,
"In other words, it is context switching.",0,
Swapping time – Suspension decision is taken by medium term scheduler.,1,
Medium term scheduler is used for swapping that is moving the process from main memory to secondary and vice versa.Multiprogramming – We have many processes ready to run.,0,
There are two types of multiprogramming:Pre-emption – Process is forcefully removed from CPU.,0,
Pre-emption is also called as time sharing or multitasking.Non pre-emption – Processes are not removed until they complete the execution.,0,
"Degree of multiprogramming –The number of processes that can reside in the ready state at maximum decides the degree of multiprogramming, example, if the degree of programming = 100, this means 100 processes can reside in the ready state at maximum.",1,
A computer without a program running is just an inert hunk of electronics.,0,
The first thing a computer has to do when it is turned on is to start up a special program called an operating system.,1,
The operating system’s job is to help other computer programs to work by handling the messy details of controlling the computer’s hardware.The boot process is something that happens every time you turn your computer on.,0,
"You don’t really see it, because it happens so fast.",0,
"You press the power button come back a few minutes later and Windows XP, or Windows Vista, or whatever Operating System you use is all loaded.",0,
"The BIOS chip tells it to look in a fixed place, usually on the lowest-numbered hard disk (the boot disk) for a special program called a boot loader (under Linux the boot loader is called Grub or LILO).",1,
The boot loader is pulled into memory and started.,0,
The boot loader’s job is to start the real operating system.,1,
(Power On Self Test) The Power On Self Test happens each time you turn your computer on.,1,
It sounds complicated and that’s because it kind of is.,0,
Your computer does so much when its turned on and this is just part of that.It initializes the various hardware devices.,0,
It is an important process so as to ensure that all the devices operate smoothly without any conflicts.,0,
BIOSes following ACPI create tables describing the devices in the computer.The POST first checks the bios and then tests the CMOS RAM.,1,
"If there is no problem with this then POST continues to check the CPU, hardware devices such as the Video Card, the secondary storage devices such as the Hard Drive, Floppy Drives, Zip Drive or CD/DVD Drives.",1,
If some errors found then an error message is displayed on the screen or a number of beeps are heard. These beeps are known as POST beep codes.,1,
"The Master Boot Record (MBR) is a small program that starts when the computer is booting, in order to find the operating system (example Windows XP).",1,
"This complicated process (called the Boot Process) starts with the POST (Power On Self Test) and ends when the Bios searches for the MBR on the Hard Drive, which is generally located in the first sector, first head, first cylinder (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1).A typical structure looks like:The bootstrap loader is stored in computer’s EPROM, ROM, or another non-volatile memory.",0,
"When the computer is turned on or restarted, it first performs the power-on-self-test, also known as POST.",0,
"If the POST is successful and no issues are found, the bootstrap loader will load the operating system for the computer into memory.",0,
"The computer will then be able to quickly access, load, and run the operating system.",1,
init is the last step of the kernel boot sequence.,0,
It looks for the file /etc/inittab to see if there is an entry for initdefault.,1,
It is used to determine initial run-level of the system.,1,
A run-level is used to decide the initial state of the operating system.Some of the run levels are:0 –> System Halt 1 –> Single user mode3 –> Full multiuser mode with network5 –> Full multiuser mode with network and X display manager6 –> RebootThe above design of init is called SysV- pronounced as System five.,0,
Several other implementations of init have been written now.,0,
Some of the popular implementatios are systemd and upstart.,1,
Upstart is being used by ubuntu since 2006.,1,
More details of the upstart can be found here.,0,
The next step of init is to start up various daemons that support networking and other services.,1,
X server daemon is one of the most important daemon.,0,
"It manages display, keyboard, and mouse.",0,
When X server daemon is started you see a Graphical Interface and a login screen is displayed.,1,
"CPU Scheduling, Multilevel Queue Scheduling This Scheduling is like Multilevel Queue(MLQ) Scheduling but in this process can move between the queues.",0,
"keep analyzing the behavior (time of execution) of processes and according to which it changes its priority.Now, look at the diagram and explanation below to understand it properly.",0,
"Now let us suppose that queue 1 and 2 follow round robin with time quantum 4 and 8 respectively and queue 3 follow FCFS.One implementation of MFQS is given below –  When a process starts executing then it first enters queue 1.In queue 1 process executes for 4 unit and if it completes in this 4 unit or it gives CPU for I/O operation in this 4 unit than the priority of this process does not change and if it again comes in the ready queue than it again starts its execution in Queue 1.If a process in queue 1 does not complete in 4 unit then its priority gets reduced and it shifted to queue 2.Above points 2 and 3 are also true for queue 2 processes but the time quantum is 8 unit.In a general case if a process does not complete in a time quantum than it is shifted to the lower priority queue.In the last queue, processes are scheduled in FCFS manner.A process in lower priority queue can only execute only when higher priority queues are empty.A process running in the lower priority queue is interrupted by a process arriving in the higher priority queue.Well, above implementation may differ for example the last queue can also follow Round-robin Scheduling.",0,
A process in the lower priority queue can suffer from starvation due to some short processes taking all the CPU time.,1,
A simple solution can be to boost the priority of all the process after regular intervals and place them all in the highest priority queue.,0,
"Firstly, it is more flexible than the multilevel queue scheduling.To optimize turnaround time algorithms like SJF is needed which require the running time of processes to schedule them.",0,
But the running time of the process is not known in advance.,0,
MFQS runs a process for a time quantum and then it can change its priority(if it is a long process).,0,
Thus it learns from past behavior of the process and then predicts its future behavior.This way it tries to run shorter process first thus optimizing turnaround time.MFQS also reduces the response time.,0,
"Consider a system which has a CPU bound process, which requires the burst time of 40 seconds.The multilevel Feed Back Queue scheduling algorithm is used and the queue time quantum ‘2’ seconds and in each level it is incremented by ‘5’ seconds.Then how many times the process will be interrupted and on which queue the process will terminate the execution?",0,
Process P needs 40 Seconds for total execution.,0,
At Queue 1 it is executed for 2 seconds and then interrupted and shifted to queue 2.,0,
At Queue 2 it is executed for 7 seconds and then interrupted and shifted to queue 3.,0,
At Queue 3 it is executed for 12 seconds and then interrupted and shifted to queue 4.,0,
At Queue 4 it is executed for 17 seconds and then interrupted and shifted to queue 5.,0,
At Queue 5 it executes for 2 seconds and then it completes.,0,
Hence the process is interrupted 4 times and completes on queue 5.,0,
"It is more flexible.It allows different processes to move between different queues.It prevents starvation by moving a process that waits too long for lower priority queue to the higher priority queue.For the selection of the best scheduler, it require some other means to select the values.It produces more CPU overheads.It is most complex algorithm.",0,
Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the user and computer hardware.,1,
The purpose of an operating system is to provide a platform on which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.An operating system is a piece of software that manages the allocation of computer hardware.,0,
"The coordination of the hardware must be appropriate to ensure the correct working of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper working of the system.Example: Just like a boss gives order to his employee, in the similar way we request or pass our orders to the Operating System.",0,
"The main goal of the Operating System is to thus make the computer environment more convenient to use and the secondary goal is to use the resources in the most efficient manner.An operating system is a program on which application programs are executed and acts as an communication bridge (interface) between the user and the computer hardware.The main task an operating system carries out is the allocation of resources and services, such as allocation of: memory, devices, processors and information.",0,

Don’t stop learning now.,0,
While creating a process the operating system performs several operations.,0,
"To identify the processes, it assigns a process identification number (PID) to each process.",0,
"As the operating system supports multi-programming, it needs to keep track of all the processes.",1,
"For this task, the process control block (PCB) is used to track the process’s execution status.",1,
"Each block of memory contains information about the process state, program counter, stack pointer, status of opened files, scheduling algorithms, etc.",1,
All these information is required and must be saved when the process is switched from one state to another.,0,
"When the process makes a transition from one state to another, the operating system must update information in the process’s PCB.A process control block (PCB) contains information about the process, i.e.",0,
"registers, quantum, priority, etc.",0,
"The process table is an array of PCB’s, that means logically contains a PCB for all of the current processes in the system.Pointer – It is a stack pointer which is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process.Process state – It stores the respective state of the process.Process number – Every process is assigned with a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.Program counter – It stores the counter which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.Register – These are the CPU registers which includes: accumulator, base, registers and general purpose registers.Memory limits – This field contains the information about memory management system used by operating system.",0,
"This may include the page tables, segment tables etc.Open files list – This information includes the list of files opened for a process.Miscellaneous accounting and status data – This field includes information about the amount of CPU used, time constraints, jobs or process number, etc.The process control block stores the register content also known as execution content of the processor when it was blocked from running.",0,

The operating system takes care of the allotment of CPU time to different processes.,1,
"When a process finishes its CPU processing after executing for the allotted time period, this is called scheduling.",1,
There are various type of scheduling techniques that are used by the operating systems: Process which need the shortest CPU time are scheduled first.,0,
Each process is assigned a fixed CPU execution time in cyclic way.,0,
"In this scheduling, processes are scheduled according to their priorities, i.e., highest priority process is schedule first.",0,
"If priorities of two processes match, then schedule according to arrival time    The Operating System communicates with hardware and the attached devices and maintains a balance between them and the CPU.",0,
This is all the more important because the CPU processing speed is much higher than thatof I/O devices.,0,
"In order to optimize the CPU time, the operating system employstwo techniques – Buffering and Spooling.In this technique, input and output data is temporarily stored in Input Buffer and Output Buffer.",0,
"Once the signal for input or output is sent to or from the CPU respectively, the operating system through the device controller moves the data from the input device to the input buffer and for the output device to the output buffer.",0,
"In case of input, if the buffer is full, the operating system sends a signal to the program which processes the data stored in the buffer.",1,
"When the buffer becomes empty, the program informs the operating system which reloads the buffer and the input operation continues.",1,
This is a device management technique used for processing of different tasks on the same input/output device.,0,
When there are various users on a network sharing the same resource then it can be a possibility that more than one user might give it a command at the same point of time.,0,
"So, the operating system temporarily stores the data of every user on the hard disk of the computer to which the resource is attached.",0,
The individual user need not wait for the execution process to be completed.,0,
Instead the operating system sends the data from the hard disk to the resource one by one.,0,
"In a computer, both the CPU and the I/O devices interact with the memory.",0,
When a program needs to be executed it is loaded onto the main memory till the execution is completed.,1,
Thereafter that memory space is freed and is available for other programs.,1,
The common memory management techniques used by the operating system are Partitioning and Virtual Memory.The total memory is divided into various partitions of same size or different sizes.,0,
This helps to accommodate number of programs in the memory.,0,
The partition can be fixed i.e.,0,
remains same for all the programs in the memory or variable i.e.,0,
memory is allocated when a program is loaded on to the memory.,1,
"The later approach causes less wastage of memory but in due course of time, it may become fragmented.This is a technique used by the operating systems which allow the user can load the programs which are larger than the main memory of the computer.",0,
In this technique the program is executed even if the complete program can not be loaded inside the main memory leading to efficient memory utilization.,0,
"The operating System manages the files, folders and directory systems on a computer.",1,
Any data on a computer is stored in the form of files and the operating system keeps information about all of them using File Allocation Table (FAT).,1,
"The FAT stores general information about files like filename, type (text or binary), size, starting address and access mode (sequential/indexed sequential/direct/relative).",1,
"The file manager of the operating system helps to create, edit, copy, allocate memory to the files and also updates the FAT.",1,
The operating system also takes care that files are opened with proper access rights to read or edit them.,1,
Priority Scheduling We have already discussed about the priority scheduling in this post.,0,
It is one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems.,0,
Each process is assigned a priority.,0,
Process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on.In this post we will discuss a major problem related to priority scheduling and it’s solution.,0,
"starvation or indefinite blocking is phenomenon associated with the Priority scheduling algorithms, in which a process ready to run for CPU can wait indefinitely because of low priority.",1,
"In heavily loaded computer system, a steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from ever getting the CPU.",0,
"There has been rumors that in 1967 Priority Scheduling was used in IBM 7094 at MIT , and  they found a low-priority process that had not been submitted till 1973.",0,
As we see in the above example process having higher priority than other processes getting CPU earlier.,0,
"We can think of a scenario in which only one process is having very low-priority (for example 127) and we are giving other process with high-priority, this can lead indefinitely waiting for the process for CPU which is having low-priority, this leads to .",0,
Further we have also discuss about the solution of starvation.,0,
Deadlock occurs when none of the processes in the set is able to move ahead due to occupancy of the required resources by some other process,1,
Starvation occurs when a process waits for an indefinite period of time to get the resource it requires.Other name of deadlock is .,1,
"Other name of starvation is .When deadlock occurs no process can make progress, while in starvation apart from the victim process other processes can progress or proceed.Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.For example, if priority range from 127(low) to 0(high), we could increase the priority of a waiting process by 1 Every 15 minutes.",0,
Eventually even a process with an initial priority of 127 would take no more than 32 hours for priority 127 process to age to a priority-0 process.,0,
In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPU’s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible.,1,
However multiple processor scheduling is more complex as compared to single processor scheduling.,1,
In multiple processor scheduling there are cases when the processors are identical i.e.,0,
"HOMOGENEOUS, in terms of their functionality, we can use any processor available to run any process in the queue.Approaches to Multiple-Processor Scheduling –One approach is when all the scheduling decisions and I/O processing are handled by a single processor which is called the Master Server and the other processors executes only the user code.",0,
This is simple and reduces the need of data sharing.,0,
This entire scenario is called Asymmetric Multiprocessing.A second approach uses Symmetric Multiprocessing where each processor is self scheduling.,0,
All processes may be in a common ready queue or each processor may have its own private queue for ready processes.,0,
The scheduling proceeds further by having the scheduler for each processor examine the ready queue and select a process to execute.Processor Affinity –Processor Affinity means a processes has an affinity for the processor on which it is currently running.When a process runs on a specific processor there are certain effects on the cache memory.,0,
The data most recently accessed by the process populate the cache for the processor and as a result successive memory access by the process are often satisfied in the cache memory.,1,
"Now if the process migrates to another processor, the contents of the cache memory must be invalidated for the first processor and the cache for the second processor must be repopulated.",1,
"Because of the high cost of invalidating and repopulating caches, most of the SMP(symmetric multiprocessing) systems try to avoid migration of processes from one processor to another and try to keep a process running on the same processor.",1,
"This is known as PROCESSOR AFFINITY.There are two types of processor affinity:Soft Affinity – When an operating system has a policy of attempting to keep a process running on the same processor but not guaranteeing it will do so, this situation is called soft affinity.Hard Affinity – Hard Affinity allows a process to specify a subset of processors on which it may run.",0,
Some systems such as Linux implements soft affinity but also provide some system calls like sched_setaffinity() that supports hard affinity.,1,
Load Balancing is the phenomena which keeps the workload evenly distributed across all processors in an SMP system.,1,
Load balancing is necessary only on systems where each processor has its own private queue of process which are eligible to execute.,1,
Load balancing is unnecessary because once a processor becomes idle it immediately extracts a runnable process from the common run queue.,1,
"On SMP(symmetric multiprocessing), it is important to keep the workload balanced among all processors to fully utilize the benefits of having more than one processor else one or more processor will sit idle while other processors have high workloads along with lists of processors awaiting the CPU.There are two general approaches to load balancing :Push Migration – In push migration a task routinely checks the load on each processor and if it finds an imbalance then it evenly distributes load on each processors by moving the processes from overloaded to idle or less busy processors.Pull Migration – Pull Migration occurs when an idle processor pulls a waiting task from a busy processor for its execution.Multicore Processors –In multicore processors multiple processor cores are places on the same physical chip.",0,
Each core has a register set to maintain its architectural state and thus appears to the operating system as a separate physical processor.,1,
SMP systems that use multicore processors are faster and consume less power than systems in which each processor has its own physical chip.However multicore processors may complicate the scheduling problems.,1,
When processor accesses memory then it spends a significant amount of time waiting for the data to become available. This situation is called MEMORY STALL.,1,
"It occurs for various reasons such as cache miss, which is accessing the data that is not in the cache memory.",0,
In such cases the processor can spend upto fifty percent of its time waiting for data to become available from the memory.,0,
To solve this problem recent hardware designs have implemented multithreaded processor cores in which two or more hardware threads are assigned to each core.,0,
"Therefore if one thread stalls while waiting for the memory, core can switch to another thread.There are two ways to multithread a processor :Coarse-Grained Multithreading – In coarse grained multithreading a thread executes on a processor until a long latency event such as a memory stall occurs, because of the delay caused by the long latency event, the processor must switch to another thread to begin execution.",0,
The cost of switching between threads is high as the instruction pipeline must be terminated before the other thread can begin execution on the processor core.,1,
Once this new thread begins execution it begins filling the pipeline with its instructions.Fine-Grained Multithreading – This multithreading switches between threads at a much finer level mainly at the boundary of an instruction cycle.,0,
The architectural design of fine grained systems include logic for thread switching and as a result the cost of switching between threads is small.Virtualization and Threading –In this type of multiple-processor scheduling even a single CPU system acts like a multiple-processor system.,0,
"In a system with Virtualization, the virtualization presents one or more virtual CPU to each of virtual machines running on the system and then schedules the use of physical CPU among the virtual machines.",1,
Most virtualized environments have one host operating system and many guest operating systems.,1,
The host operating system creates and manages the virtual machines.,1,
"Each virtual machine has a guest operating system installed and applications run within that guest.Each guest operating system may be assigned for specific use cases,applications or users including time sharing or even real-time operation.",1,
Any guest operating-system scheduling algorithm that assumes a certain amount of progress in a given amount of time will be negatively impacted by the virtualization.,0,
A time sharing operating system tries to allot 100 milliseconds to each time slice to give users a reasonable response time.,1,
A given 100 millisecond time slice may take much more than 100 milliseconds of virtual CPU time.,1,
"Depending on how busy the system is, the time slice may take a second or more which results in a very poor response time for users logged into that virtual machine.",1,
"The net effect of such scheduling layering is that individual virtualized operating systems receive only a portion of the available CPU cycles, even though they believe they are receiving all cycles and that they are scheduling all of those cycles.",1,
"Commonly, the time-of-day clocks in virtual machines are incorrect because timers take no longer to trigger than they would on dedicated CPU’s.",1,
Virtualizations can thus undo the good scheduling-algorithm efforts of the operating systems within virtual machines.,1,
"An error in one program can adversely affect many processes, it might modify data of another program, or also can affect the operating system.",0,
"For example, if a process stuck in infinite loop then this infinite loop could affect correct operation of other processes.",0,
"So to ensure the proper execution of the operating system, there are two modes of operation:",0,
"User mode – When the computer system run user applications like creating a text document or using any application program, then the system is in the user mode.",0,
"When the user application requests for a service from the operating system or an interrupt occurs or system call, then there will be a transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill the requests.",1,
"To switch from kernel mode to user mode, mode bit should be 1.",0,
"When the system boots, hardware starts in kernel mode and when operating system is loaded, it start user application in user mode.",1,
"To provide protection to the hardware, we have privilged instructions which execute only in kernel mode.",1,
If user attempt to run privileged instruction in user mode then it will treat instruction as illexampleal and traps to OS.,0,
"Real time system means that the system is subjected to real time, i.e., response should be guaranteed within a specified timing constraint or system should meet the specified deadline.",1,
"For example: flight control system, real time monitors etc.",0,
Types of real time systems based on timing constraints:,0,
Hard real time system – This type of system can never miss its deadline.,1,
Missing the deadline may have disastrous consequences.,0,
The usefulness of result produced by a hard real time system decreases abruptly and may become negative if tardiness increases.,1,
Tardiness means how late a real time system completes its task with respect to its deadline.,1,
Example: Flight controller system.Soft real time system –This type of system can miss its deadline occasionally with some acceptably low probability.,0,
Missing the deadline have no disastrous consequences.,0,
The usefulness of result produced by a soft real time system decreases gradually with increase in tardiness.,1,
Example: Telephone switches.Reference model of real time system: Our reference model is characterized by three elements:A workload model: It specifies the application supported by system.A resource model: It specifies the resources available to the application.Algorithms: It specifies how the application system will use resources.Terms related to real time system:Job – A job is a small piece of work that can be assigned to a processor and may or may not require resources.Task – A set of related jobs that jointly provide some system functionality.Release time of a job – It is the time at which job becomes ready for execution.Execution time of a job – It is the time taken by  job to finish its execution.Deadline of a job – It is the time by which a job should finish its execution.,0,
Deadline is of two types: absolute deadline and relative deadline.,1,
Response time of a job – It is the length of time from release time of a job to the instant when it finishes.Maximum allowable response time of a job is called its relative deadline.Absolute deadline of a job is equal to its relative deadline plus its release time.Processors are also known as active resources.,0,
They are essential for execution of a job.,0,
A job must have one or more processors in order to execute and proceed towards completion.,1,
"Example: computer, transmission links.Resources are also known as passive resources.",0,
A job may or may not require a resource during its execution.,0,
"Example: memory, mutex",0,
Two resources are identical if they can be used interchangeably else they are heterogeneous.,1,
"Convoy Effect is phenomenon associated with the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm, in which the whole Operating System slows down due to few slow processes.",1,
"FCFS algorithm is non-preemptive in nature, that is, once CPU time has been allocated to a process, other processes can get CPU time only after the current process has finished.",1,
This property of FCFS scheduling leads to the situation called Convoy Effect.,0,
"Suppose there is one CPU intensive (large burst time) process in the ready queue, and several other processes with relatively less burst times but are Input/Output (I/O) bound (Need I/O operations frequently).Steps are as following below: The I/O bound processes are first allocated CPU time.",0,
"As they are less CPU intensive, they quickly get executed and goto I/O queues.Now, the CPU intensive process is allocated CPU time.",0,
"As its burst time is high, it takes time to complete.While the CPU intensive process is being executed, the I/O bound processes complete their I/O operations and are moved back to ready queue.However, the I/O bound processes are made to wait as the CPU intensive process still hasn’t finished.",0,
"When the CPU intensive process gets over, it is sent to the I/O queue so that it can access an I/O device.Meanwhile, the I/O bound processes get their required CPU time and move back to I/O queue.However, they are made to wait because the CPU intensive process is still accessing an I/O device.",0,
"As a result, .Hence in Convoy Effect, one slow process slows down the performance of the entire set of processes, and leads to wastage of CPU time and other devices.",1,
"To avoid Convoy Effect, preemptive scheduling algorithms like Round Robin Scheduling can be used, as the smaller processes don’t have to wait much for CPU time – making their execution faster and leading to less resources sitting idle.",1,
"In computing, there exist two type processor i.e., 32-bit and 64-bit.",1,
These processor tells us how much memory a processor can have access from a CPU register.,1,
"For instance,A 32-bit system can access 232 memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory.",1,
"A 64-bit system can access 264 memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Quintillion bytes of RAM.",1,
"In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it. Most computers made in the 1990s and early 2000s were 32-bit machines.",0,
"The CPU register stores memory addresses, which is how the processor accesses data from RAM.",1,
One bit in the register can reference an individual byte in memory,1,
"So a  system can address a maximum of 4 GB (4,294,967,296 bytes) of RAM.",1,
"The actual limit is often less around , since part of the register is used to store other temporary values besides memory addresses.",0,
"Most computers released over the past two decades were built on a 32-bit architecture, hence most operating systems were designed to run on a 32-bit processor.A register can theoretically reference 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 GB (16 exabytes) of memory.",0,
This is several million times more than an average workstation would need to access.,0,
What’s important is that a 64-bit computer (which means it has a 64-bit processor) can access more than 4 GB of RAM.,0,
"If a computer has 8 GB of RAM, it better have a 64-bit processor.",0,
"Otherwise, at least 4 GB of the memory will be inaccessible by the CPU.",0,
"A major difference between is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks.",0,
64-bit processors can come in  for home computing.,0,
"Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster.",0,
"Software programs that require many calculations to function smoothly can operate faster and more efficiently on the multi-core 64-bit processors, for the most part.",0,
"Using 64-bit one can do a lot in multi-tasking, user can easily switch between various applications without any windows hanging problems.",0,
"Gamers can easily plays High graphical games like Modern Warfare, GTA V, or use high-end softwares like Photoshop or CAD which takes a lot of memory, since it makes multi-tasking with big softwares easy and efficient for users.",0,
However upgrading the video card instead of getting a 64-bit processor would be more beneficial.,0,
A computer with a 64-bit processor can have a 64-bit or 32-bit version of an operating system installed.,0,
"However, with a 32-bit operating system, the 64-bit processor would not run at its full capability.",0,
"On a computer with a 64-bit processor, we can’t run a 16-bit legacy program.",1,
"In any Operating System, it is necessary to have Dual Mode Operation to ensure protection and security of the System from unauthorized or errant users .",1,
This Dual Mode separates the User Mode from the System Mode or Kernel Mode.,1,
The Instructions that can run only in Kernel Mode are called privileged Instructions.,1,
"Privileged Instructions possess the following characteristics: (i) If any attempt is made to execute a privileged Instruction in User Mode, then it will not be executed and treated as an illegal instruction.",0,
The Hardware traps it to the Operating System.,0,
"Before transferring the control to any User Program, it is the responsibility of the Operating System to ensure that the timer is set to interrupt.",1,
"Thus, if the timer interrupts then the Operating System rexampleains the control.Thus, any instruction which can modify the contents of the Timer is a privileged Instruction.",0,
privileged Instructions are used by the Operating System in order to achieve correct operation.,0,
Various examples of privileged Instructions include:I/O instructions and Halt instructionsTurn off all InterruptsSet the TimerContext SwitchingClear the Memory or Remove a process from the MemoryModify entries in Device-status tableThe Instructions that can run only in User Mode are called Non-privileged Instructions .,0,
"Various examples of Non-privileged Instructions include: Reading the status of Processor, reading the System Time, Generate any Trap Instruction, Sending the final prinout of Printer",0,
"In order to change the mode from privileged to Non-privileged, we require a Non-privileged Instruction that does not generate any interrupt.",1,
